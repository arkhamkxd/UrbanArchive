Xenu then imparted his vast wisdom to the body thetans through colossal 3D movies. When body thetans are attached to our bodies, they share the wisdom of Xenu with us so that we can attain [enlightenment].\n\nXenutarians believe that Scientologists have been sadly deceived by a corrupted version of the true story of Xenu.",
