Rather, they feel as though their gender is related to that thing, \"inspired by\" that thing, and similar experiences (which yes, is different than \"identifying as\" something).\n\nXenogenders are often used by [neurodivergent] people (people who are not neurotypical), because said people find them to be an easier way to describe their gender identity experience. And while there are neurogenders, which are exclusive to [neurodivergent] people/people which specific neurodivergencies, other xenogenders can be used by anyone and everyone, if they feel as though a certain label fits them.\n\nBecause pronouns do not equal gender, xenogenders are not the same thing as neopronouns. However, many people who use xenogenders often use their relating sets of neopronouns.",

This does not mean that they identify as a flower, bud, blossom, ect. John Doe's [gender identity] is valid.\"",
