In the following decade, he immigrated to the [United States] after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. He died in April 1955 at age 76. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.\r\nAlbert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany. He grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical equipment. Einstein’s mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, born two years after him. Einstein attended [elementary school] at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated there and struggled with the institution’s rigid pedagogical style. He also had what were considered speech challenges. However, he developed a passion for classical music and [playing the violin], which would stay with him into his later years.

The name \"Allosaurus\" means \"different lizard\" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its [discovery]). It is derived from the Greek ἄλλος/allos (\"different, other\") and σαῦρος/sauros (\"lizard / generic reptile\"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod [dinosaurs], it has long attracted [attention] outside of paleontological circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life.",
      "example": "As the most abundant large predatory dinosaur in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus was at the [top of the food chain], probably preying on [contemporaneous] large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had [cooperative] social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. Due to having a much weaker bite force and a much wider gape than most other large carnivorous dinosaurs, it may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.",

  "art student": [
    {
      "defid": 3693825,
      "definition": "There are many different kinds of art students in the world, all with a different perogative and reason for persuing the artistic field. I'm going to outline the main ones, but remember that all these [definitions] aren't set in stone and can be blended together.\r\n\r\n1. Lazy art student. These people usually study art because they think it will be easy and that anyone can paint a [masterpiece]. They think they can just shit whatever onto a canvas and say \"TA-DA!\" and they'll get an A+. But they find out in good time that [there is nothing] easy about art school and that they actually HAVE to broaden their horizons and work hard to be successful.\r\n\r\n2. [Procrastinator] art students. Not to be confuse with Lazy art students. These are the students that are likely to have a plethora of ideas and emotions and great things circling their mind. But since they're procrastinators they don't attempt to put it to paper until the very night before an assignment is due. In frustration they'll give up on what was potentially something great and do something much simpler, without as much thought.\r\n\r\nUnlike lazy art students, they most likely DO know that it takes hard work to be an artist, they simply do not have the drive it requires.\r\n\r\n3. Shy art students. Like [procrastinating] art students, the shy ones probably know that you must work and have great ideas to work with. But the one true flaw in these art students is that they fear what people will say them and their art.\r\n\r\nThey worry if the message is too contoversial or just stupid, if this nude will be regarded as gratuitous, if people will find his/her technique ameteur, and so on and so forth. So they will usually change it to make it more [streamlined] and give it a less interpretable message.\r\n\r\n4. Rich art students. Just what it sounds like. These are rich kids who decide to use their college fund to attend art school. These people are usually a mixture of different kinds of art students, [particularly] lazy and annoying ones. Occasionally you will find a rich art student that is actually serious about being there and really knows what they're doing with their life, but more than likely it's someone who'se trying to get back at their parents for pushing them to hard to be a lawyer/doctor/join [the family business]/etc.\r\n\r\n5. Annoying art students. These students more than likely love art and love to draw/paint/whatever but they get very obsessive about it and often place themselves upon a pedestal as \"one of [the greatest]\". Sometimes they will refuse and even get offended at serious critiques. And last, there are a few, like lazy and rich art students, that have little talent or vision to offer.\r\n\r\n6. Serious art students. These are the students that know what they're doing at art school, they know it's not easy and that it takes work and they welcome the challenge. They might not always have a fantastic vision to work with but they can and will find a way to make something better. They study art movements, history, techniques, various mediums and more [importantly] other artists.",
      "example": "Examples of what art students are likely to say.\r\n\r\n1. \"I don't  really have any skills but I need to amke a living. I know! I'll just go to art school and become famous, it'll be fun and easy.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Oh man, this is due tomorrow, but i just can't seem to paint what I'm seeing in my mind... whatever, I'll just paint a forest and I'll get it right next time.\"\r\n\r\n3.\"Maybe I shouldn't draw a nude afterall, I mean, what if everyone calls me a pervert? I'll just put a nice dress on her.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Dammit dad, [I don't want to] be a doctor! I want to live on the edge! I'm going to art school!\"\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\"I wish my parents would understand that [I don't want to] go to law school. I love art and I want to go to art school.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"This painting is so great, everyone will love it. [There's no way] they could critique something so perfect. If they do they're just jealous.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"This is okay, but how can I make it better? I'll get someone else to come and look at it and tell me what they think.
