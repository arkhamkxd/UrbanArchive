In the following decade, he immigrated to the [United States] after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. His work also had a major impact on the development of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. He died in April 1955 at age 76. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.\r\nAlbert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany. He grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical equipment. Einstein’s mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, born two years after him. Einstein attended [elementary school] at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated there and struggled with the institution’s rigid pedagogical style. He also had what were considered speech challenges. However, he developed a passion for classical music and [playing the violin], which would stay with him into his later years. Most significantly, Einstein’s youth was marked by deep inquisitiveness and inquiry.",

The name \"Allosaurus\" means \"different lizard\" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae (at the time of its [discovery]). It is derived from the Greek ἄλλος/allos (\"different, other\") and σαῦρος/sauros (\"lizard / generic reptile\"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod [dinosaurs], it has long attracted [attention] outside of paleontological circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several films and documentaries about prehistoric life.",
      "example": "As the most abundant large predatory dinosaur in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus was at the [top of the food chain], probably preying on [contemporaneous] large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had [cooperative] social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. Due to having a much weaker bite force and a much wider gape than most other large carnivorous dinosaurs, it may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.",

    {
      "defid": 3693825,
      "definition": "There are many different kinds of art students in the world, all with a different perogative and reason for persuing the artistic field. I'm going to outline the main ones, but remember that all these [definitions] aren't set in stone and can be blended together.\r\n\r\n1. Lazy art student. These people usually study art because they think it will be easy and that anyone can paint a [masterpiece]. They think they can just shit whatever onto a canvas and say \"TA-DA!\" and they'll get an A+. But they find out in good time that [there is nothing] easy about art school and that they actually HAVE to broaden their horizons and work hard to be successful.\r\n\r\n2. [Procrastinator] art students. Not to be confuse with Lazy art students. These are the students that are likely to have a plethora of ideas and emotions and great things circling their mind. But since they're procrastinators they don't attempt to put it to paper until the very night before an assignment is due. In frustration they'll give up on what was potentially something great and do something much simpler, without as much thought.\r\n\r\nUnlike lazy art students, they most likely DO know that it takes hard work to be an artist, they simply do not have the drive it requires.\r\n\r\n3. Shy art students. Like [procrastinating] art students, the shy ones probably know that you must work and have great ideas to work with. But the one true flaw in these art students is that they fear what people will say them and their art.\r\n\r\nThey worry if the message is too contoversial or just stupid, if this nude will be regarded as gratuitous, if people will find his/her technique ameteur, and so on and so forth. So they will usually change it to make it more [streamlined] and give it a less interpretable message.\r\n\r\n4. Rich art students. Just what it sounds like. These are rich kids who decide to use their college fund to attend art school. These people are usually a mixture of different kinds of art students, [particularly] lazy and annoying ones. Occasionally you will find a rich art student that is actually serious about being there and really knows what they're doing with their life, but more than likely it's someone who'se trying to get back at their parents for pushing them to hard to be a lawyer/doctor/join [the family business]/etc.\r\n\r\n5. Annoying art students. These students more than likely love art and love to draw/paint/whatever but they get very obsessive about it and often place themselves upon a pedestal as \"one of [the greatest]\". Sometimes they will refuse and even get offended at serious critiques. And last, there are a few, like lazy and rich art students, that have little talent or vision to offer.\r\n\r\n6. Serious art students. These are the students that know what they're doing at art school, they know it's not easy and that it takes work and they welcome the challenge. They might not always have a fantastic vision to work with but they can and will find a way to make something better. They study art movements, history, techniques, various mediums and more [importantly] other artists.",
      "example": "Examples of what art students are likely to say.\r\n\r\n1. \"I don't  really have any skills but I need to amke a living. I know! I'll just go to art school and become famous, it'll be fun and easy.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Oh man, this is due tomorrow, but i just can't seem to paint what I'm seeing in my mind... whatever, I'll just paint a forest and I'll get it right next time.\"\r\n\r\n3.\"Maybe I shouldn't draw a nude afterall, I mean, what if everyone calls me a pervert? I'll just put a nice dress on her.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Dammit dad, [I don't want to] be a doctor! I want to live on the edge! I'm going to art school!\"\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n\"I wish my parents would understand that [I don't want to] go to law school. I love art and I want to go to art school.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"This painting is so great, everyone will love it. [There's no way] they could critique something so perfect. If they do they're just jealous.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"This is okay, but how can I make it better? I'll get someone else to come and look at it and tell me what they think.

There is emerging evidence of genetic predispositions and exciting research confirming the lack of mirror neurons (look it up) in this kind of brain. Brain scans of those who express Asperger's traits confirm verifiable deviations from those of neuro-typical people.  The neurological differences manifest as difficulty reading and interpreting facial expressions and other forms of non-verbal communication; physical clumsiness (also neurological) and sometimes neurological differences present as a rigid, linear cognitive style.  People with Asperger's usually have above average to superior IQ scores and sometimes possess an [extraordinary] fund of knowledge about a particular subject.  People with Asperger's often find success as engineers and computer programmers due to their preference and skill with mechanical things and relative weak social skills.\r\n\r\nThere is no known treatment for Asperger's disoder however the most common secondary symptoms/co-morbid conditions [anxiety and depression] can be successfully treated and controlled in most people.",
      "example": "James was bullied in school because he was different \"geeky\" an did not recognize the taunts of his cruel classmates, often in the form of dirty looks, laughing at and other non-verbal abuses.  This led to a series of maladaptive coping behaviors including school avoidance, anxiety, and depression.  James had a part time job at Apple's genius bar where he was able to work among others with similar strengths.\r\n\r\nBy learning about Asperger's, learning social pragmatics and working with [professionals] who knew how to explain James' cognitive style, James went on to win the Nobel prize in [mathematics] after a [distinguished] career at MIT. ,",

Any [ingredients] can be used for the sauces, but tempoyak (durian) is the most popular among Bruneians.\n\nWhen you eat ambuyat, you must use traditional chopsticks called candas. You have to put candas into ambuyat, pull it out and roll it. This is a bit difficult, so many people fail at this stage. However, if you've successfully done, put it into a sauce and you can eat.\n\nAmbuyat can be said an equivalent to rice and [noodle]. It is also eaten with [side dishes], such as fish and [vegetables]. Sometimes, it is fried with eggs and soy sauces and became ambuyat goreng.\n\nAmbuyat is also known as linut in Malaysia and papeda in Indonesia.",

Once it has a milk-like texture, pour some boiled water and mix until it becomes as sticky as mochi. Now, ambuyat is done. You must use candas to roll and dip into a tempoyak sauce to eat, but a spoon can also be used [if you don't] have candas or have an issue for using it. You may also fry with eggs and soy sauces to make ambuyat goreng, [something] like nasi goreng or mi goreng.",

This leads to them speeding up when you approach and slowing down when you get stuck and have to slow. Sometimes, Rice-Rocketeers trade in their brethren's cars and buy BMW's. However, they still act the same way. Also, it must be noted that this particular breed of Asian Driver has the curious tendency of backing their car up into parking spaces as opposed to driving into them. This always results in about 5 re-tries that hold up other parkers waiting their turn, and also tends to lead to a poor parking job with their car twisted or crooked [in the space].

Right [across the street] from the Smithhaven Mall in a large strip mall with a Waldbaums food store, many (what look sketch) food and business stores, a Marshalls, and a shoe store that has been closed for over a year it is definitely the meeting place for the thousands of teens from the surrounding areas as well as the students from SUNY Stony Brook. Very often one will go with a pack of friends to a movie and then across a sidestreet to the Friendly's diner to feed like a pack of wolves. Most Friday nights are spent in this fashion.\r\n\r\nThough Lowes movie company being bought out by AMC at this location, all of the signage still says Lowes as well as the theater design and tacky red and black motif from the Lowes era. In fact no one even refers to the theater as AMC 17 though the uniforms declare it so. Even the coupons from Lowes must be accepted at this location just because the signs haven't been changed. \r\n\r\nKnown by its employees as [hell in a handbasket] for the [particularly] rude Long Island North Shore [upper middle class] as well as the rude middle and lower classes it just gives one the entire spectrum of the unhappy people that reside there. \r\n\r\nRecently updated with an IMAX screen in the largest theater those in the front rows will have an even worse neckache than before with the regular screen. Though the new IMAX will pay for itself after one showing since the tickets for it are more expensive.",
