Usually it isn't found in really thin women (usually you just see their actual spine) nor heavyset women (whose backs are usually just doughey and flat). Most men, consciously or not, find this part of the body sexy.\r\n\r\nThe reason this area is called a Cum Trough is because when engaging in [doggy style] sex or a facsimile thereof, the man may be so inclined to pull out of the woman and [ejaculate] on her mid back. Rather than just leaking every which way, the Cum Trough acts as a trench or trough of sorts and causes all the semen to stay in a neat straight line on the woman's back, presumably until she stands up/rolls to either side.",

Classify is also known for having an abnormally large penis to the point where people are afraid of the BDE vibes that radiate off his body. If you hear anything about Classify, be sure to not go outside and instantly hide your girl as he will steal them in a heart beat. You don't go outside? Well you're still not safe. Classify also will steal your girl in [video games] by impressing them with his impeccable aim and his immense amount of skill in Fortnite and in many other games",

The academical out look is a very high standard, for a lucky few this means Clarkston Science Math and Technology Academy (CSMTA) or [International] Bachaloriete (IB) and they dont flaunt it either. Clarkston is a [wonderfull] community with an awesome high school.",

Around mid 2007 it seemed that the hip-hop industry was, while keeping a few [legitimate] artists, cranking out one-hit wonder after one-hit wonder. These artists would be what is called \"hip-crop.\"",
      "example": "Example 1--\r\nA: I just got the new CD from [Simple Plan]!\r\nB: You listen to that crop punk?\r\n\r\nExample 2--\r\nA: *[Listening] to iPod* \"I'm hot cuz I'm fly! You ain't cuz you not!\"\r\nB: What are you [listening] to?\r\nA:",

Some old ideas are overdone because they work- if a work or an idea were so new and untried that it avoided all clichés, it would be foreign. Few people would be able to accept it as anything more than the direct result of a drug trip.\r\nAvoiding all clichés is more or less [impossible] because some ideas are [etched] in the human psyche as unavoidable aspects of everyday life.\n\nThe truth is that the majority of ideas, in their purest forms, have been done; the challenge is how they are put together, and [the creative process] is partially selfish anyway. While an artist of some other sort may aim to please his/her audience, if said person wants to write about elves or [teenage drama], that person should be allowed to do so without angering a horde of angry critics.\n\nThe issue for critics, then, should not fall in the overuse of tried ideas, but in their execution and how they are valued as a whole.",

In all three religions, a single God stays [in the middle] of all conflict, with differing views depending on the religion one is looking at.\r\n\r\nThe major difference with Christianity, though, is that [Christians] believe that Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was born around the year 0 (while most scholars now believe the date could have been a couple of years later), was and is divine. The story behind Jesus is that God, the loving, caring, creator of the universe, saw that the world was slowly sinking into it's own evil, and sent his only son to save the people, by offering himself as a sacrifice to cleanse the sins of the people of the earth. This form of sacrifice dates back to early Jewish practices, except that instead of an [innocent human], animals were sacrificed to please God and beg for forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that [Jesus Christ] did exist, as three major world religions do make references about him, only in differing ways. The Jews think he was a prophet, not the Messiah (perhaps because his teaching went against many of the things that Jews originally thought), the Muslims think he was a prophet, but that he had little significance besides the fact that he was a wise man, and the Christians think he was divine. \r\n\r\n[Personal Opinion]: For all of you athiests out there, I [understand] that believing in an all powerful, universe [controlling] Mega-God may be hard, but look around. Do you honestly think that [everything], from the sky, to the earth, to yourself, just happened? It is almost foolish to say that [everything] just \"happened\", because there is so much proof against it. \r\n\r\n[Think of it] this way: The Jews are foretold to be God's chosen people. They are, in a sense, protected by God, though it may not seem to always be that way. Want an example? In Jewish history, past and present, Jews have fought in wars after wars, been persecuted, killed, tortured, and nearly wiped out, yet they are still a powerful world religion, mainly in [the middle east]. Do you see anybody around now who worships Baal, the fertility god? Or Ra, the god of the sun? The answer is no. Those religions died off after a short time, because they had nothing backing them up. In Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, all three worship the same God, just in different ways, with different beliefs.\r\n\r\nNow, [to the point] of Jesus the Christ. Scholars know, without a doubt, that Jesus was an actual man, that he did live, around the year 0. \r\n\r\nPeople think Christians and Jews are so different, when in fact, they really aren't. Christians are just Jews who have realized their Messiah, while Jews think he still is to come.  \r\n\r\nMy own personal belief? God does have a son. His name was Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph the Carpenter and Mary. I do believe that he was born of a virgin, and for those who stop there when [thinking about it], remember, this is God who we're talking about. If he wants Jesus to be born of a virgin, so be it. If he wants Him to be born from a man... so be it as well, but I really don't think he would do that. \r\n\r\nI also believe that Jesus died at the hand of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, and after three days, He rose again, as was foretold in Jewish prophecy. \r\n\r\nAnd now, for my final statement to defend my case, think of Christianity in one last way. In the words of C.S. Lewis, let's say that you athiests are right. We die, thats it, nothing more. Everybody loses. But let's say I'm right. You still lose, but I get eternity in Heaven with the God of the universe and his only begotten son. \r\n\r\nLet's just say I'm pretty sure of myself.",
      "example": "Christianity has been twisted, molted, and [perverted] in every possible way, by people who aren't willing to admit that their lives are not perfect. [Those who] do realize this and repent are assured life eternal. [Those who] realize it but do nothing will end up spending eternity in the lake of fire.",

Solving this question would require the use of complex algorithms like stochastic gradient ascend etc. Thankfully we dont have to answer the harder version of the problems since we are only [looking for] an [approximation] of the true answer. Back to the simplifed question. Now that we've decided our variable intervals only thing left would be to construct a cock appeal function from given values. To attain given values we would have to use reasonably sized polls, voted by the genshin players from multiple genshin fanbases. Using the poll with 10332 answers named \"Size or Girth?🥵🥵\" we could graph this function with relative accuracy. After the graphing, the statistics show us that girth/bend has %63,15 more effect on sexual appeal compared to size when the other is at its bare minimum. Thus approximating the questions answer as girth having more effect on cock appeal.",

The younger son of Sweyn of Denmark, Canute accompanied his father on the [expedition] of 1013 that invaded England and forced Æthelred to flee to Normandy. When Sweyn died (1014), the Danes in England swore fealty to Canute, but on Æthelred's return from Normandy, Canute withdrew to Denmark, where his older brother, Harold, had become king. In 1015, Canute reinvaded England with a powerful army that conquered most of Wessex, harried the Danelaw, and conquered Northumbria. After the Danish victory in the battle of Assandun, Canute divided England with Edmund [Ironside], Æthelred's son. When Edmund died, late in 1016, Canute was accepted as sole king. He gave England peace and strove to continue English traditions by restoring the church to high place and codifying English law. To forestall dynastic quarrels he banished his wife (and their son Sweyn) and married Emma, the widow of Æthelred. His son by Emma was Harthacanute. In 1018 or 1019 he succeeded to the throne of Denmark and was forced to lead several expeditions to assert his rights there and in the Danish provinces in Norway. In 1028, after an uprising had expelled Olaf II of Norway, Canute was [recognized] as ruler of that kingdom. He made his son Harthacanute king of Denmark, and in 1029 he made his son Sweyn king of Norway, with Sweyn's mother as regent. She and Sweyn were driven out by 1035, and Norway was ruled by Olaf's son Magnus. Canute [established] friendly relations with the [Holy Roman Empire] and attended the coronation of Conrad II in Rome in 1027. At the end of his reign Canute led an army into Scotland to stop Scottish invasions under Malcolm II. Canute was succeeded by his [illegitimate] son, Harold Harefoot, then by Harthacanute. The name also appears as Cnut or Knut. Kudos to [Wikipedia].",

This species can be quite dangerous, and cunning, often able to abduct young men from their group, isolate them, and devour them, usually by sucking their blood. It is purportedly a heavy creature, usually a white middle aged woman, although there have been reports of chupacabra behavior within almost all ethnicities. The chupacabra is usually only identified retrospectively, in the evening hours, when a male member of a group is reported missing. His friends realize that the last time he was seen was with an aggressive woman, spilling alcohol all over herself, [foaming at the mouth] and slurring her speech, who led him away, never to be seen again. These are the tactics used by the chupacabra.\n\nEyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1985 at a Grateful Dead concert in Michigan, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and more recently at Coachella as well as Austin City Limits, but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence.
