They may spend an excessive amount of time researching composting techniques and experimenting with different composting systems.\n\n[Perfectionism] in composting: People with composter syndrome strive for perfection in their composting efforts. They may feel a strong need to achieve the ideal compost composition, texture, and odor. They are often dissatisfied if their compost does not meet their self-imposed standards.\n\nAnxiety about waste management: Individuals with composter syndrome may experience heightened anxiety or guilt when organic waste is discarded rather than being composted.
