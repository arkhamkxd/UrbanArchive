Usually it isn't found in really thin women (usually you just see their actual spine) nor heavyset women (whose backs are usually just doughey and flat). Most men, consciously or not, find this part of the body sexy.\r\n\r\nThe reason this area is called a Cum Trough is because when engaging in [doggy style] sex or a facsimile thereof, the man may be so inclined to pull out of the woman and [ejaculate] on her mid back. Rather than just leaking every which way, the Cum Trough acts as a trench or trough of sorts and causes all the semen to stay in a neat straight line on the woman's back, presumably until she stands up/rolls to either side.",

If you have a Colleena as an enemy, she WILL take you down. A Colleena can be very competitive and cold. For some reason, a Colleena’s hands are always cold. I don’t know why?

Don’t underestimate a Colleena’s shortness, she’s got a LOT of power and can be very strong. She will try to [overthrow] and challenge a person who meets her abilities. She’s very competitive in a [competition] and will try her hardest to best you. She is a storm to mess with. A Colleena will also tackle you( that’s how a Colleena hugs) Watch our though, she can backstab you anytime though.

      "definition": "An illness that appears abruptly after using/reusing previously used or contaminated cotton filters in the [preparation] of intravenous drugs. Someone who does IV drugs needs to filter the solution with a cotton to take out the particulate matter, and a small piece of cotton rolled up into a ball is often used as a filter when the drug solution in initially drawn up into the syringe.\n\nContrary to popular belief and junkie myth, cotton fever is not the result of [accidentally] [injecting] small cotton fibers into your blood, but is actually caused by an endotoxin from the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans that can reside in picked cotton. The toxin is disolved into the drug solution, and when the injector injects the drug, the toxin causes an immediate and severe flu-and-fever like illness that can last anywhere from several hours to a day or two.\n\nCotton fever may also be caused by the reuse of previously used cotton filters. The filter, after its first use, is a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, all of which can be [accidentally] injected and result in illness if the cotton is reused.",
      "example": "John was real sick with cotton fever on Wedesday... First his muscles all tensed up and he felt nauseous. He started to sweat, and he felt like he was [boiling hot]. He got a really bad fever, and starting having muscle aches and cold chills. All this [happened] in the span of about 2 minutes... John just slept it off for six hours, woke up, fixed a [clean shot], and felt better.",
