Usually it isn't found in really thin women (usually you just see their actual spine) nor heavyset women (whose backs are usually just doughey and flat). Most men, consciously or not, find this part of the body sexy.\r\n\r\nThe reason this area is called a Cum Trough is because when engaging in [doggy style] sex or a facsimile thereof, the man may be so inclined to pull out of the woman and [ejaculate] on her mid back. Rather than just leaking every which way, the Cum Trough acts as a trench or trough of sorts and causes all the semen to stay in a neat straight line on the woman's back, presumably until she stands up/rolls to either side.",

By using various spreads, one can give a detailed reading. Each of the cards has a meaning, and when you lay them out in a certain way the interpretations deepen. The truth is there is a myriad of spreads and thousands of possible readings. These nuances require a good interpreter of the basic meanings of each card, as well as an [understanding] of what they mean together in certain locations. Many people compare cartomancy to tarot but there is a difference. While they can be read similarly, tarot decks and regular card decks are pretty different.

Some old ideas are overdone because they work- if a work or an idea were so new and untried that it avoided all clichés, it would be foreign. Few people would be able to accept it as anything more than the direct result of a drug trip.\r\nAvoiding all clichés is more or less [impossible] because some ideas are [etched] in the human psyche as unavoidable aspects of everyday life.\n\nThe truth is that the majority of ideas, in their purest forms, have been done; the challenge is how they are put together, and [the creative process] is partially selfish anyway. While an artist of some other sort may aim to please his/her audience, if said person wants to write about elves or [teenage drama], that person should be allowed to do so without angering a horde of angry critics.\n\nThe issue for critics, then, should not fall in the overuse of tried ideas, but in their execution and how they are valued as a whole.",
