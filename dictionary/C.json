They may spend an excessive amount of time researching composting techniques and experimenting with different composting systems.\n\n[Perfectionism] in composting: People with composter syndrome strive for perfection in their composting efforts. They may feel a strong need to achieve the ideal compost composition, texture, and odor. They are often dissatisfied if their compost does not meet their self-imposed standards.\n\nAnxiety about waste management: Individuals with composter syndrome may experience heightened anxiety or guilt when organic waste is discarded rather than being composted.

      "definition": "(also called KAOS or Current 156)\r\na magickal [spirituality] with little or no set-in-stone ritual,dogma,deities, or any other object of faith to which the initiate is bound. The chaos magician only places faith in himself. It is generally agreed among chaos magicians that magick is a process of the psyche, not a nebulous 'spirit' or some such thing. All older magickal paths are seen by chaos initiates as different forms of the same psychic process, which may be imitated with any and all forms of ritual and symbolism that hold a personal meaning for the magician. Gods and ceremonial equipment, if present at all, are seen as symbolic, [psychological] tools used as vehicles into the magician's inner potential. Once this potential is fully realized, the God of use may simply be tossed aside. \r\n\r\nChaos magick finds its origin partially in the 'sigil working' of Austin Osman Spare. In this form of magickal practice, the magician creates a symbol, or sigil, [representing] a goal or desire. Using any method he/she chooses, the magician then goes into a trance state wherein the sigil is the sole object of consciousness. after the climax of this trance state is done with, the sigil is to be \"banished\", or forgotten, so that the goal it represents will ingrain itself into the unconscious mind of the caster.\r\nSome sources have it that the history of chaos magick runs further back. Such sources trace it to the anti-witchcraft hysteria of medieval Christian Europe, in which witches would have to invent new methods of magick so that they would not be caught doing obviously magickal ritual.\r\n\r\nThe first major occultist to write about these ideas calling them 'chaos magick' was Peter Carroll in his books Liber Null and [Psychonaut]. Far-out writer [William S. Burroughs] is also known for his invocation of Arabic gods by chaotic methods. Comic artist Grant Morrisson has also written extensively on the subject. Phil Hine's chaotic path revering Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and other gods from the Lovecraftian mythos has become widely popular, almost to the point of becoming a traditional path in itself. \r\n\r\nEven chaotic magick has its own organizations. The most popular one is called the Illuminates of Thanateros. The dual nature of their god (eros,love and life+Thanatos, death and the will to die) brings to mind the Gnostic yin-yang-ish deity Abrasax. \r\nThee Temple ov Psychick Youth, a splinter group led by artist, musical pioneer, cultural engineer, and \"pandrogyne\" Genesis P-Orridge, places a high emphasis on sigil work focused on the liberation of the [individual] from conditioned modes of thought, as well as bringing about a world of [absolutely free] artistic expression. They show a strong [preference] for [masturbation] as sigil work, and hold both the male and female ejaculants as sacred. The Church of the Subgenius, which deifies Bob the used car dealer, puts out [sarcastically] toned texts and seems to be focused on pranks.",
