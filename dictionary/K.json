One of the issues with this, however, is it becomes difficult to [distinguish] between its use as a noun or an adjective.\r\n\r\nAs a noun, \"krabitz\" can mean:\r\nasshole\r\nbirch\r\nbitch\r\ndickhead\r\njackass\r\nstupid\r\n\r\nThe root word \"krabitz\" can be extended to \"krabitzing\" and \"krabitzed\" for active and past tense verbs. As a verb, \"krabitz\" can mean:\r\nbirch\r\nbitch\r\nshit\r\n\r\nAs an adjective, \"krabitz\" can mean:\r\ndifficult\r\nshifty\r\nstubborn",
      "example": "For the examples, let me use two characters named \"Ben\" and \"Bob\".\r\n\r\nAs a noun:\r\nBen: Can [you get me] that report?\r\nBob: I've got other stuff to do, that report is meaningless.\r\nBen: I need that report right the fuck now!\r\nBob: Why are you being a krabitz?\r\n\r\nBen: [Look at that] krabitz! He almost hit that car and hasn't bothered to even slow down!\r\n\r\nAs a verb:\r\nBob: Be back in a second; I gotta krabitz.\r\n\r\nBob: Why don't you answer your phone?\r\nBen: Because [the last time] I talked with her she krabitzed for an hour about the dumbest stuff.",
