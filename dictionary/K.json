Ketamine is a fine [white power] that is taken in small amounts. The most common dosage is 3-4 bumps, which brings a \"loose and flowy\" feeling to the users limbs, and extreme euphoria. You can easily recognize people on ketamine because the way they walk is similar to someone that is extremely drunk. The peak lasts for 30-40 mins, and the comedown is another 60 mins. Some say that ketamine feels similar to MDMA, others claim that it can be as harsh as PCP. If the user takes too much, they can easily get stuck in a \"k-hole\", which can send you into another level of being. Ketamine has a bad reputation because it has been used as a horse [tranquilizer] in the past, although ketamines effects aren't as harsh as most say.",

Defines a person who **Involuntarily Identify As a Nonhuman and/or Fictional entity**. Can be spelt Otherkind. The entity one is kin w = a Kintype. 'kins don't [necessarily] enjoy being their kintype + dont have to relate to the+, since Otherkinity is not a choice. Otherkin has been coined after Elvenkind: ppl needed a term for those who weren't elf kins but were 'kin. Coined (as \"otherkind\") on April 18, 1990 in Elfinkind Digest #16 and the variant \"otherkin\" on July 10, 1990.\r\n~Alterhuman = a person who has a subjective identity which is beyond the scope of what is traditionally considered ‚Äòbeing human‚Äô. The [Yandere Bitch Club] (on tumblr) began making claims abt 'kin and spreading the idea Kinning was a hobby / relating and such. It quickly escalated and. Pls [do your research] before defining terms. This is Otherkin, despite people not [understanding] it and wanting to change the term against a majority of actual Otherkins' will(if you only [value] a few selectively picked Fictionkins' opinion and not Plantkins' nor Therians', you just don't care for Otherkins' opinions)\r\n~Alterhuman terms that are still underrated despite meaning what the wishkins want to mean when they say they kin : Otherhearted / Otherkith, Otherlink, having Synpaths / Synpathizer (definition from @stirdrawsandreblaws on tumblr)",
      "example": "A random actual 'Kin: I'm a wolfkin! I found out my otherkinity when I were 14 but it took me long to figure out what specie of animal I were and to narrow down the kind of wolf and such. Though there exist many other types of way people explain their Otherkinity, I personally am spiritual and believe the Wolf I'm kin with, which is called Glen, was my past life. I don't get memories in my case, but I do feel Supernumerary [Phantom Limbs] and sometimes feel my tail.\n\nWishkin: Yeah I'm actually a Copinglink /a Synpathizer/Fictionhearted but I say I kin things because it's popular to say that! I love kinning. (btw the person writing this is a copinglink and here to say no, copinglink isn't kin because our identity is Voluntarily chosen though don't make copinglinks look bad please).\n\nGuys it's not too late to switch terms, you can 100% [take your time] about all this and reflect. Maybe search a bit about Otherkinity and the actual Alterhuman Community. You can recognize your past msitakes, nobody will every judge someone for using terms that fit your experiencr since 'kins dont want us to continue watering down their terms. Also, it may be hard to do the switch but really, it's worth it because you'll help your actual community grow a bit and be able to find people with similar experiences more easily if all terms were used correctly.\r\nThank you for reading SO MUCH, [it's hard to explain] it all shortly [unfortunately].",
