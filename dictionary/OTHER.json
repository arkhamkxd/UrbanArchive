So they look to the 90s as their favorite decade.They get 90s history from the net,older brothers or sisters hand-me-downs,and [the spill] of late 90s media into the 2000s.They refuse to compare a teenage schoolkid of the 90s to a teenage 00s kid, as they are also often also a teenager.They ignore the first half of the 90s,claiming it didn't feel like the 90s-as they were too young to remember or not born.So they only see similarities with the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nA '90s kid' has grown into a fad for the under 25s today (not much older than 16), to desperately want to be part of this group. They hold on to the idea that 'kid' can only mean pre-teen. [The reality] is that a 'kid of a decade' was created by adults,and has [always been about] people in their most [influential] time of growing up, from youth into adulthood. This time as a kid is your adolescence. Old enough to take in what the decade offers but young enough to be heavily influenced.\r\n70's kids went to 70's discos, wore 70's clothing, went to 70's concerts, knew [the celebrities] and news of the time,still young, but they were not born in the 70's and limited to pre-teen culture (eg childrens clothes, toys and cartoons).
