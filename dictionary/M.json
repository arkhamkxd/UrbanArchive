Derived from the modern latin word, gnomus, a gnome is similar to a dwarf, and characteristized by his hesitancy to interact with humans. As a result of their reluctance to associate with humans, the need for persons with a specific set of skills that would allow them to interact with such creatures was required. Thus, the birth of the Gnomer; an individual that has devoted their life to the study and care of gnomes. From breeding to attempting to train these diminutive creatures, Gnomers could engage in variety of specializations for Gnoming. However, as the centuries turned over from the Renaissance Era, the attitude and temperament of gnomes evolved. This evolution led to the need for Gnomers to adapt and Gnoming became more about [controlling] gnomes rather than studying them. As gnomes became more violent, including the famous Gnome Rebellion of 1756, more and more gnomers went missing. These stories include perhaps the most famous Misgnomer, Gregory \"[Little Foot]\" Mactitus, who went missing shortly after the gnome rebellion of 1756 and stories from [Little Foot] being [incorporated] into gnome culture as a diety-like [King] to [Little Foot] being tortured and sacrificed in attempt to turn the Gnome Clan, Dirty Devils, fortunes following their extensive losses during the rebellion.",

This game even has all of [the Super Mario] Kart tracks available for play as unlockables.\r\nMario Kart Double Dash!! (Nintendo Gamecube): One of the more insane games in the series, this one changed things over entirely with each kart being driven by two characters, which could be swapped during a race. This also featured the ability to pick from multiple vehicles as opposed to being limited to racing in tiny Go-Karts.\r\n[Mario Kart DS] (Nintendo DS): The latest game in the series is one of the first to include free online play via Nintendo WiFi Connection.

As for the word itself, though gradually becoming less and less used, it can still be heard in some remote villages of the magnificent area.\n\n2) Someone who has cazzimma, usually someone who has the courage to show up in Campobasso's Terminal Bus stop with iron chains to beat up someone, or to boost their ego. Standing in the shady area of [the Terminal], Minchiaduros usually lurk [in the shadows] where they are able to move quickly and swiftly, constantly keeping eye contact with their victims, almost as if they were [challenging] you to a fight at IPIA (remarkable culture and arts hotspot located in the prestigious area of San Giovanni on the outskirts of Campobasso).\n\nSide note: Over time the diphthong CB has been erased by catholic church's influence, tho it is rumored that it might have started the *very real* esoteric riot of Benevento's satanist cult called \"Cacciunə\".",

Modern music is often the work of fat greedy managers churning out the sassy stylised crap in the hopes of increasing their bank balance. On the other hand, you could see it as a global conspiracy wherein the government is acting through [the music industry] to prevent bands who could deliver important social messages and revolutionary ideas from ever being successful and putting the control of the masses via the government in jeopardy. Your choice. Modern music described in the form above [usually] appeared after late 2006, and the only bands that dont fall into this category include bands who either started off before the 21st century and have remained successful to this day, or a few notable exceptions such as MGMT, Beach House, and a few other decent bands I have yet to discover. [Unfortunately], the current music scene will continue to churn out this garbage and drown out decent bands who could bring forth a new musical revolution etcetera... so [unfortunately] for now, its here to stay :'(",
