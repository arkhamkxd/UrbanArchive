Derived from the modern latin word, gnomus, a gnome is similar to a dwarf, and characteristized by his hesitancy to interact with humans. As a result of their reluctance to associate with humans, the need for persons with a specific set of skills that would allow them to interact with such creatures was required. Thus, the birth of the Gnomer; an individual that has devoted their life to the study and care of gnomes. From breeding to attempting to train these diminutive creatures, Gnomers could engage in variety of specializations for Gnoming. However, as the centuries turned over from the Renaissance Era, the attitude and temperament of gnomes evolved. This evolution led to the need for Gnomers to adapt and Gnoming became more about [controlling] gnomes rather than studying them. As gnomes became more violent, including the famous Gnome Rebellion of 1756, more and more gnomers went missing. These stories include perhaps the most famous Misgnomer, Gregory \"[Little Foot]\" Mactitus, who went missing shortly after the gnome rebellion of 1756 and stories from [Little Foot] being [incorporated] into gnome culture as a diety-like [King] to [Little Foot] being tortured and sacrificed in attempt to turn the Gnome Clan, Dirty Devils, fortunes following their extensive losses during the rebellion.",

(Nintendo Gamecube): One of the more insane games in the series, this one changed things over entirely with each kart being driven by two characters, which could be swapped during a race.

I study at a school that has all of these, and nobody would even dream of accusing my school of being a McDojo. The ignorant martial artists that like to blam Taekwondo because it is a newer style and because it's popular have no clue. There are Kung Fu schools that fingers should be pointed at. There's a perfect example in DengFeng, the Chinese [Martial Arts] City. The monks will sign any foreigner off as a master just so they can get a good laugh. Taekwondo is not a bullshido style.

Why was that so very difficult?”1\r\n\r\nThe nattily-dressed young nobleman escorted the comely French [prostitute] to a rented room on the second floor of a nondescript maison on the outskirts of Paris. The Marquis de Sade had been frequenting such houses during his trip to the capital, a trip he had ostensibly taken for business reasons. The true nature of his business, however, was the pursuit of pleasure, the kind that the nobility of France had enjoyed for [generations] without repercussion or recrimination. The newly wed Marquis had been staging garden-variety orgies at several maisons he had rented in and around Paris during October of 1763. However, he had a more singular encounter in mind for himself and the young [prostitute], Mlle. Jeanne Testard.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the room, the Marquis bolted the door behind them and immediately demanded to know if Mlle. Testard had [religious] convictions, if she was a faithful adherent to the teachings and practices of [the Roman Catholic] faith. When she responded [affirmatively], the Marquis proceeded to harangue her with the most vile and degrading insults. To Testard’s horror he also began to engage in the most provocative and blasphemous acts, including [masturbating] into a chalice, referring to the Lord as “[motherfucker]” and inserting two communion hosts into the terrified young woman before entering her himself, all the while screaming, “If thou art God, avenge thyself!”\r\n\r\nMlle. Testard, who had already gotten much more than she had bargained for with the Marquis, was mortified by his next request, which was for her to heat a cat-o-nine-tails in the fire until it glowed red, and then to beat him with it. She was then to select the whip of her choosing for him to do the same to her. When she refused to let him beat her, he proceeded to [masturbate] with a pair of crucifixes, after which he held her at sword-point while forcing her to repeat vulgar, blasphemous impieties.\r\n\r\nAt 9:00 am the following day, Mlle. Testard’s procuress arrived to find her young charge in a most hysterical state. They rushed immediately to the local police commissioner who took the young woman’s deposition. Donatien Alphonse Francois, Marquis de Sade was arrested ten days later by Paris Police Inspector Louis Marais, and, for the first of several times in his life, the Marquis was imprisoned for acting on his lewd and debauched convictions.",

      "definition": "Colloquial version of the [English language] as spoken in Malaysia and it is a portmanteau of the word Malay and English. The language shares substantial [linguistic] similarities with Singlish in Singapore. In real essence, Manglish and Singlish are one and the same although there are a few slang words that exist in one and not in another. For all practical purposes, Manglish and Singlish are subsets of the same group.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, English as spoken in Malaysia is based on British English and called Malaysian English. British spelling is generally followed. However, the influence of [American English] modes of expression and slang is strong, [particularly] among Malaysian youth.\r\n\r\nSince 1968, Malay, or Bahasa Melayu, has been the country's sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish (also means Mangled English). An example is suffixing sentences with lah, e.g. \"Don't be so worried-lah\", which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious, the suffix has no specific meaning. Although Chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix lah and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, and Tamil, which are other major dialects and languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some [anachronistic] British terms from the era of British colonization (see \"gostan\" and \"outstation\" below).\r\n\r\n{source: wikipedia}",
      "example": "Manglish Particles:\r\n\r\n1. \"lah\" - Often used at the end of sentences, used to affirm a statement (similar to 'of course'), usually ends with an [exclamation] mark. Eg. \"Don't be an idiot lah!\"\r\n\r\n2. \"mah\" - Used at the end of sentences, used to affirm a sentence, but not as strongly as \"lah\". Eg. \"She's like that mah..\"\r\n\r\n3. \"nah\" - Derived from the Malay expression, \"Nah!\". Used when giving something to another person. Eg. \"Nah, take this!\"\r\n\r\n4. \"meh\" - Used when asking a question, especially when one is skeptical of something. Eg. \"Really meh?\"\r\n\r\n5. \"liao\" - Means 'already'. Eg. \"No more liao.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"ah\" - Used at the end of sentences, unlike 'meh' the question is [rhetorical]. Eg. \"Why is he like that ah?\" Can also be used to when asking a genuine question. Eg. \"Is that true ah?\" Besides that, some people use it when referring to a subject before making a comment (often used to make a [negative comment]). Eg. \"My brother ah, always disturb me!\"\r\n\r\n7. \"lor\" - Used when explaining something. Eg. \"Like that lor!\"\r\n\r\n8. \"leh\" - Used to soften an order, making it less harsh. Eg. \"Give me that leh.\"\r\n\r\n9. \"one\" - Used as an emphasis at the end of a sentence. Eg. \"Why is he so naughty one?\"\r\n\r\n10. \"what\" - Unlike the British/Americans, the word 'what' is often used as an [exclamation] mark, not just to ask a question. Eg. \"What! How could you do that?\"\r\n\r\n11. \"got\" - Used as a literal translation from the Malay word 'ada'. The arrangement of words are often also literally translated. Eg. \"You got anything to do?\" (\"Kamu ada apa-apa nak buat?\"). This [particular] particle is widely abused in Manglish, mainly because of the [difficulty] for the Manglish speaker of comprehending the various correct uses of the English verb 'to have'. Therefore, 'got' is substituted for every tense of the verb.

So I'll explain [abstract art]. \r\n\r\nThe most misunderstood form of visual art. The passive art audience will say [abstract art] is meaningless because all it is is a bunch of meaningless shapes and colors and that anybody can do it. Yes, anybody can do [abstract art] by throwing paint on a canvas but not many are actually good at it. That's like saying anybody can make abstract noise out of a guitar, very few are actually really good at it. It takes a sensitive and trained eye to know good marks and good brush strokes and composition just like music. Just like listening to abstract music from an instrument. And no, not anyone could throw paint on a canvas and make tons of money off of it. If that were the case everyone would be rich and famous and there are very few rich and famous abstract artist out there today. Only people who were the first at what they did are really famous. People know nothing about this art form and still judge it out of ignorance, they haven't done a single bit of research and think they know [everything] about abstract art and what it means. I could say [Jimmy Page] is a [pretentious hipster] because he makes a bunch of non sensical sounds out of a guitar and [I don't know what] they mean. The purpose of abstract art is not always to interpret the meaning for himself. There is such thing as bad abstract art and good abstract art. People who hate abstract art are normally hypocrits because they whine about modern abstract art yet they go on to enjoy other forms of abstract art like it's normal. Music is an abstract form of art, beats and guitars, and sound is meaningless. Design is abstract where shape, color, form, composition is abstract. Compositional shots in film is abstract, there is color, space, etc. Just about anything designed is abstract. Look at a nice car that you like for instance, it's the shapes and colors that please your eyes. Look at anything artificial that you think looks good, it is still the shape, color, form, composition that pleases the eye not the fact that it is an object. A painting is still an object, it doesn't always have to represent anything. That's like me saying why is your car red? what does it mean? why are there different shapes on your car, it makes no sense. Look at all the buildings all around you, look at all the things around you, there is abstract elements that look good everywhere. Some will go as far as saying abstract art is actually from analyzing and object where the origin of the abstract is actually an object being abstracted. Also consider the concepts put into abstract art.",

      "definition": "With her unique talent and signature vocal abilities, Mariah Carey commanded the world’s attention when she made her musical debut in the early nineties. In less than a decade, Mariah Carey emerged as [one of the most] popular and widely acclaimed talents in music. As a singer and songwriter, Carey has been recognized with the most prestigious accolades in the industry including two Grammy Awards, eight [American Music Awards], Billboard's “Artist of the Decade\" Award and the World Music Award for “World's Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium\" to name a few. As the best-selling female performer of all time, Mariah Carey has continuously raised the bar and set the standard of excellence within the music industry worldwide. \r\n\r\nCarey started singing at the tender age of four and her innate talent quickly progressed. While attending middle school, she began honing her songwriting skills and upon high school graduation she immediately left for [New York City] to pursue a lifetime ambition - her dream of a musical career. \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Carey’s luminous talent quickly distinguished her in New York and her vocals were in demand by a variety of artists. Her major break came while singing backup for Brenda K. Starr, who gave Mariah’s demo tape to then Sony Music [Entertainment] Chief Tommy Mottola. Soon afterwards, Mottola signed Mariah to her first recording contract with Columbia Records. \r\n\r\nWith a fresh-face and angelic allure Mariah exploded on the scene with a signature style that displayed a vocal intensity that had never been seen before. Released in 1990, Carey’s self-titled debut was an immense hit, firmly establishing her as [one of the most] talented artists in the industry. The album which spawned an [extraordinary] four #1 singles: “Vision of Love,\"\"Love Takes Time,\"\"Someday,\" and \"[I Don't Wanna] Cry,\" led to two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Vocalist. Carey continued her success with a series of singles from Emotions and MTV Unplugged albums that consistently placed her at the top of the charts. \r\n\r\nWith the 1993 release of Music Box, which included the chart-topping hit singles \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero,\" Carey produced her most commercially successful album to date going an astounding ten-times platinum. Carey soon hit yet another career milestone with the release of her first holiday album [Merry Christmas], which contained the instant classic \"All I Want for Christmas is You.\" Over the next two years, Carey continued her relentless chart domination with the album Daydream (1995). Daydream’s “Fantasy” single debuted at number one, making Mariah the second artist in history and the first female performer to accomplish that feat. The album’s other single, \"One Sweet Day\" (recorded with Boyz II Men), stayed at the top of the charts for a mind-blowing 16 weeks. Carey followed with the Hip-Hop and R&B infused Butterfly which introduced a new chapter in Mariah’s career teaming her with the hottest names in the music business such as Sean Combs and Missy Elliott. \r\n\r\nA true testament to her longevity, Carey released #1’s, a compilation of her chart-topping hits in 1998. The album also included a new song, \"When You Believe\" (from the film “The Prince of Egypt”), a duet with [Whitney Houston], pairing two of the most successful female recording artists in Pop history.Rainbow, with its chart-topping hit \"[Heartbreaker],\" followed in 1999 with startling success. \r\n\r\nAlways at the top of her game, the ever-thriving Carey sparked the interest of the Universal Music Group's Island Def Jam Records who in May 2002 signed her to an exclusive recording contract. Later that year, Carey made her Island Def Jam debut with the release of the multi-platinum Charmbracelet. \r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade of hits that include the staggering success of 15 #1 singles, Carey released her latest self-penned album The [Emancipation] of Mimi, in April 2005. \r\n\r\nTHE [EMANCIPATION] OF MIMI, Mariah's 10th studio album, is the long-awaited follow-up to 2002's RIAA platinum Charmbracelet. Heralding the new album's release, [the New York Times] ran unprecedented features two days in a row. In his Critic's Choice selection, Jon Pareles devoted a lengthy review to the album, summing up \"Mariah... makes herself a 21st-century pop contender.\" \"A Superstar Returns With Another New Self.\"",

Spawned from early forums from the custom map for Starcraft called {Aeon of Strife} and Evolved in to the most recent Defense of the Ancients or \"DotA\". The [objective] of the MOBA Genre is for each team to destroy the opponents' Base, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players [use] powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters called \"creeps\". As in role-playing games, players level up their hero and use gold to buy equipment during [the mission].\n\nEach human player must control one Hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In DotA-Allstars, players on each side choose one of ninety-five heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. Nevertheless, some heroes, given enough time, can change the outcome single-handedly, while [countering] the opposing team's heroes.\n\nBecause the game play revolves around strengthening [individual] heroes, it does not require one to focus on resource management and base-building, as in most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player [experience points]; when enough experience is accumulated, the player gains a level. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage it can inflict, and allows players to upgrade their spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource, in most cases: gold.\n\nThe typical resource gathering is based on a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities. Certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an [important] tactical element of the scenario.\n\nMost MOBA Games offer a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match.

Girls [lacrosse players] think they are awesome when in actuality these are the best years of their life and theyre going to grow up to be just like their moms, pop out a few dozen kids and eventually become chubby, depressed alcoholics. Boys [lacrosse players] are just retarded, dont know how to spell 'lacrosse' so they just call it lax, and are going to grow up to be 'baby daddys', live in Town and Country and work at Highs because they have to pay child support. The rest of sports teams are okay kids, because they all pretty much pale in comparison to the asshole lacrosse ones. Half of the teachers have been there for fourteen thousand years and the other half are about 21 and were taught by the first half. A good 25 percent of the students either do not, or choose not to, speak english. The building itself is dirty, \r\neither from rat shit or from the team of four [old] ass people that 'clean' the school. But really they are [smoking pot] in the bathrooms by the cafeteria. Between classes, if you [go to the bathroom], you can almost ALWAYS encounter a drug deal. The room numbers make NO sense. And 'up'and 'down' staircases, well dont even worry about that. You might run it to a bake out on the closed staircases though, especially if you go to the one by the art rooms. The drama kids are lame and they think they are actually going to entertain someday, since they were in the Sankey Productions. Come on, a gay math teacher whose equally gay wife acts as his beard? But the plays WERE good.  And the sets were built by the only rednecks that went therel, who hung out [in the back] of their pickups blasting country after school. The band kids are talented too, but they have far too much sex. Not that theres anything wrong with that, but they did it IN the building. Then there are the gay guys (thats what all that fluffly, polo wearing parenting will do to a boy) who youve known about since freshman year and then finally, a year after graduation, find out about for real on facebook (interested in: Men) Young life is slowly trying to take over the school. Fliers can be found all over the floors along with the rest of the shit, and in the hands of all the [second string] preppy kids who are trying to find meaning in their lives because they get benched. And when they FINALLY get married and they \r\nFINALLY have sex, they are going to push out a bunch of jesus freaks just like them. And they all live in the mount hebron [neighborhood]. Finally, there are the kids you see at graduation rehearsal, and you think to yourself 'Who the fuck is that guy?' It was a fun four years, mostly because you always had someone to \r\nmock. They were the best [for the kids] that kept themselves from being a [walking stereotype]. And even though the suicide rate is so much higher because of the horribly difficult classes, when you leave the shit hole, youre ready for higher education.

[the thing is], [charlie simpson] of busted went to the same school, as Harry Judd from mcfly. as well as, matt willis and tom fletcher both attending sylvia young theatre school. on top of all this, tom tried out for busted and ddnt make it, but became very close friends with james elliot bourne. james has helped him, and to this day, still does, and did with mcfly's new album coming out july 14th. he helps write songs and find melodies. so in a sense, and mcfly has admitted to it, busted definately helped start them off on their big breakthrough by letting mcfly tour with them at the peak of their own career. sure the music they made may seem similar in a sense, but still will never be the same. all in all, mcfly are extremely amazing, and unless you dont like them because u dont enjoy ther music, you hate them because your jealous.. and thats completely believable :",

The principal rule is that both doors cannot be open at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf a person needs to access a facility, he must access it through a mantrap. He might use a keycard to open the first door, then enter the mantrap and close the door behind him, and only then he can enter his personal PIN (for an example, could be biometric as well) which, if entered correctly, will open the second door.\r\n\r\nFailure to enter the PIN code, or trying to force either of the doors open, will trigger an alarm. An intercom system will be activated, and an announcer will notify that a guard-team has been dispatched to clear the solution, and apprehend the suspect to the police.\r\n\r\nSuch \"boxes\" [usually] also contain tailgate-prevention [technologies], so that only one person can enter at a time.\r\n\r\nIn history, mantraps could also cause deadly forces at the intruder, possibly by using a sleeping-gas, impaling spikes or emitting a high-energy noise. Such are illegal today.\r\n\r\nMantraps are very scary to the people who rarely use them. The smell, the sounds... And when you enter a mantrap, the silence is somewhat [disturbing]. There's a set amount of time in which you need to enter your code, or an alarm will be triggered. This could be 10 seconds or less.\r\n\r\nMost advanced mantraps enforce tailgating-prevention by [taking it to the next level], with pressure-sensitive plates [on the floor]. What this means is that when you show your keycard at the first door, the mantrap recognises who you are, and fetches your last weight from the databases. When you enter the mantrap, the pressure sensitive plates at the floor will measure your weight, and if it's too far off from the last weight, it'll trigger an alarm. This effectively prevents two people from going in together, but if you're carrying something heavy, you cannot pass.\r\n\r\nMetal detectors can also be included, so that if you carry ANYTHING metal, the second door won't open. A guard-team is dispatched to [investigate] [what you are] carrying in or out.",
