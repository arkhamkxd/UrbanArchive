      "defid": 8278660,
      "definition": "Contrary to Popular belief, the word Misgnomer is spelled with a silent g as to refer to a certain set of individuals--those who gnome--that have gone missing. Derived from the modern latin word, gnomus, a gnome is similar to a dwarf, and characteristized by his hesitancy to interact with humans. As a result of their reluctance to associate with humans, the need for persons with a specific set of skills that would allow them to interact with such creatures was required. Thus, the birth of the Gnomer; an individual that has devoted their life to the study and care of gnomes. From breeding to attempting to train these diminutive creatures, Gnomers could engage in variety of specializations for Gnoming. However, as the centuries turned over from the Renaissance Era, the attitude and temperament of gnomes evolved. This evolution led to the need for Gnomers to adapt and Gnoming became more about [controlling] gnomes rather than studying them. As gnomes became more violent, including the famous Gnome Rebellion of 1756, more and more gnomers went missing. These stories include perhaps the most famous Misgnomer, Gregory \"[Little Foot]\" Mactitus, who went missing shortly after the gnome rebellion of 1756 and stories from [Little Foot] being [incorporated] into gnome culture as a diety-like [King] to [Little Foot] being tortured and sacrificed in attempt to turn the Gnome Clan, Dirty Devils, fortunes following their extensive losses during the rebellion.",
