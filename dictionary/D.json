Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far. The soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\r\n\r\nThis is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made.

Upon the child removing all of the pumpkin pulp from both cavities, which was a rather tedious, but, overall, engaging event for the whole onlooking village, they'd yell out the emphatic line in their triumph.\n\n'Thou holes may be foul and rich in ferment, but no evil spirit shall have my newly claimed festive bit of nourishment! Whether sweet or sour, if it takes me more than an hour, no seeds there shall be, as you can now see, two gaping holes abound, we can now share in glee, feast we will on the plunder, evil spirits have met their thunder.'\n\nSo, 'doing the pumpkins' referred to a lovely gathering and seasonal time of fellowship, the first known reference of a DP, a rather ironic deviance from traditional Puritan [values] of chastity, loyalty, and resisting temptations of the flesh, as well as the embracing of food fetishes and butt play.",

For an unfathamoble and as yet unexplained reason, it was decided the best way to do this would be to masquerade as a [football team].\n\nThis left County with a problem, as fielding a team with 42 legs went against League regulations. Attempts to get around this by removing the rear legs of each sheep proved a rash and unpopular solution, as not only could the sheep not play football, it also made intercourse far more difficult for the good citizens of Derby.\n\nAxed from the group and traumatised by their experiences, yet unwilling to go quietly, the sheep went on to form the Derby County Supporters Club. Their influence can still be seen today in the delusional, stubborn and sexually maladjusted Derby fans.\n\nReplaced with nine [mental institution] outpatients and a cauliflower, County became masters of irony.

Other bands such as Aggression, Death, [Necrophagia], Nun Slaughter, Slaughter Lord and even Slayer contributed to the movement.  What defined death metal was the fact that it was basically an [exaggerated] form of thrash--everything from the vocals (which transformed into a mix of growling, grunting and rasping) to the drumming was made harsher and heavier than before.  The music itself became somewhat anti-rhythmic, and in some cases [experimental] (as seen with Darkthrone's Goatlord album, or the modern technicality of [Necrophagist]).  The first bands to really modernize the movement included Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse, the virtually unkown Necrovore, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Ripping Corpse, among others.  Death metal could range from the blood and gore horror imagery of Cannibal Corpse, to the satanic overtones of Deicide, to the political statements carried by Dying Fetus.  Some criticize death metal as they feel the musicians do nothing but randomly band their instruments.  Nothing could be further from the truth--listen to Morbid Angel's album Covenant, for instance, or Cannibal Corpse's Gore Obsessed, to get a better [perspective] on the scene.",

Duvall is a bit [off the beaten path], and has a tendency to become an island in the winter since the city lies in a floodplain, and has only one main access road.\n\nThe busier downtown areas are built on the hillside, where flooding is less likely (*but still possible, I've seen water on main street before*), and the river basin is populated mainly by farmers. The city of Duvall has made many efforts to improve flood conditions. Woodinville-Duvall Rd. was rebuilt after the terrible flood of 2006, when most of the residents of Duvall were housebound (or shelter-bound) and without power and other services for two weeks. The rebuild of the road included a much higher bridge, however, you still have to cross the valley to leave town. The city of Duvall is surrounded by rivers on three sides, The Snohomish, The Skykomish, and the Snoqulamie. Generally, when any portion of the river system floods here, it floods the entire basin. This includes Duvall and the [neighboring] towns of Monroe, Carnation, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. The valley in Duvall is quite expansive, and when it floods, it looks like an unimaginable amount of water as it devours the entire valley. Sometimes seagulls show up to prey on the fish (I'm guessing [that's why] they're there).\n\nDuvall is known for being a safe place that is \"out there\". A cursory glance at a map will show you that the area is, indeed, pretty isolated. This town is one of the few remaining that towns that you could sleep with all your doors unlocked and your car open with the key in the ignition, not that I'd recommend that anywhere. Duvall is home to many local farms, and has a surprising number of (family-oriented) [recreational] activities considering the size of the town.\n\nThe landscape is lush and green. The valley is open (that's the floodplain) and the hills are heavily forested in a way that only [western Washington] can offer.",

  "Dir en grey": [

      "defid": 2053188,
      "definition": "Dir en grey (said to translate into \"Coin in grey\"), was founded [February 2nd], 1997 by Niikura Kaoru. Dir en grey is spelled \"Dir en grey\", not \"Dir En Grey\" or \"Dir en Grey\", but \"Dir en grey\". The G is ALWAYS lower case. This band is often called Diru or Deg by its fans. Diru was [originally] La:Sadies back in 1995, but when bassist Kisaki left to join the group MIRAGE, they toured in Nagano under the name Deathmask with Toshiya on bass. As fans should already know, Toshiya is the current bassist. Members are as follows:\r\n\r\nKyo, prophet\r\nKaoru, lead guitar (he cheats when he plays... he tunes his guitar a certain way so that he doesn't have to move his hands around that much...)\r\nDie, rhythm guitar\r\nToshiya, bass\r\nShinya, drums\r\n\r\nBack when the band was first becoming popular, it was considered a [visual kei] group. But as of late Diru has strayed away from its visual style, and gone on to a style with less guise. Their music has a hardcore, if you will, feel to it, and features a lot more screaming than singing. Their lives are wild and crazy. Kyo has been known to scratch himself on his chest until he bleeds, and will continually punch himself [in the face] until that too has blood pouring from it, and tends to smear it over himself. A bit messy. Drummer Shinya is [absolutely] amazing, and one would not have thought a human could possibly move like that. Kaoru cheats on his chords, but other than that, is simply amazing. He writes [beautiful music] as well. Die is a grand guitarist, and I [personally] think he should play lead. Toshiya has mad bass playing skills, and they are enough to make anyone jealous. This band can hold an audience like none other. They have toured all around the globe, starting off in Asia, slowly making their way to Europe, and as of March 2006, America.\r\nAll lyrics are written by singer Kyo, who has said he will never write a song with a happy ending. Most music is written by Kaoru, although each member has written his own pieces. Kyo is a fan of BUCK-TICK, as any good Jrocker would [recognize] when they heard Children, and the words HURRY UP MODE clicked. Toshiya was [inspired by] the bassist of Luna Sea. Shinya likes to listen to pop music. Kaoru is a huge fan of hide's, and has an autograph in his home. I currently have no [information] on Die's musical tastes/inspirations.\r\nDir en grey's albums are as follows in order of release:\r\nMISSA, GAUZE, MACABRE, Kisou, six Ugly, VULGAR, Withering to death.\r\nNote Withering to death. is spelled with the period.\r\nDir en grey is a good band to start out in the Jrock genre with, but is definately the Green Day of the Jrock scene.",

The main focus of the band was it's lead singer (Tomiko Van), it's guitarist (Ryo Owatari), and it's composer (Dai Nagao), although there are other members. What sets Do As Infinity apart is their sound.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity is rooted in Rock, both old and new. Their featured guitarist, Ryo Owatari, is a skilled musician who is best known for his extremely accurate and powerful [manipulation] of his instrument, and his very Led Zeppelin/Jimi Hendrix-era guitar style. Their mix of both Rock sounds and vocals and Pop sounds and vocals helps their music have an infinite number of [possibilities].\r\n\r\nThe lead singer of the band is Tomiko Van, a vocalist whose range covers both Pop and Rock-she is best known for her soft vocals, her powerful soaring vocals, and everything in between. Stunningly gorgeous and incredibly down-to-Earth, Tomiko has helped Do As Infinity rise to the top, and has helped the band become one of the mainstays in the Japanese music industry.\r\n\r\nDai Nagao, the man who brought the band together, is the band's composer and one of the guitarists. After composing some songs for Japanese Pop stars Ayumi Hamasaki and Hitomi, Dai was given the oppurtunity to create a band of his own. Do As Infinity was created (basically, Dai created DAI). After composing the album Break of Dawn, which was among the top 10 selling albums of it's time, New World put Do As Infinity on top of the charts. Dai [eventually] stopped appearing live and in music videos with the band, so that he could focus on composing for them [behind the scenes]. He eventually created his own record label.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity was created in 1999, and very [unfortunately] (and a shock to all of their fans), they split up in [2005]. [September 29], 1999 to [September 29], 2005. They remain one of [the greatest] Pop/Rock groups of all time, Japanese or not.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity may not be around anymore, but Tomiko Van is continuing her career as a solo artist, and Ryo Owatari is dedicating himself full-time to a side project he worked on during their last year together (the he works with now is Missile Innovation, under the Tearbridge Records label). Dai Nagao will continue to compose for Avex Trax and his own record label.",

The second Doink, also evil, was played by Steve Keirn, best known for his work in Florida and Memphis with Stan Lane as the Fabulous Ones during the 1980s. These Doinks feuded with Crush (formerly of Demolition; real name Bryan Adams, most recently of the team Kronik).  Doink started getting bigger face (good guy) reactions from the crowd and was turned face.  Steve Lombardi, best known as the [Brooklyn Brawler], took over the gimmick for a short time, until Gary Fall, aka Ray Apollo or Ray Licaccelli, took over the gimmick full-time.  Doink turning face is generally considered to be the moment when the Doink gimmick lost its edge and its coolness.  The addition of his midget sidekick Dink didn't help matters.   The good Doink feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow, who [deserved better].
