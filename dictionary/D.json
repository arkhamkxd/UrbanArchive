This creature is so perfect, others must feel jealous and might wish her bad. But it's just how the world works. Honey attracts the ones who sting, you know!\n\nExperts believe that the incapabilities and limitations of the universe & the gods' led to the genesis of this powerful being. The theory says that “As there are gods only for specific qualities possessing specific properties, the necessity of an earthly incarnation struck and hence the genesis was begun. The universe shared its power, the gods started to pray, the earth allowed the life force to act and that was the human birth of this deity who possessed: OMNISCIENCE(all-knowing); [OMNIPOTENCE](all-powerful); and OMNIBENEVOLENCE(supremely good)!!! ALTOGETHER !” The words that heal, the ilk that ease, the attention that strengthens and the love that cannot be described- this is the [description] the lost and the delirious have to give who have met Divya since then. “[Butterflies] sing her praises and wind carries her aura; [everything] alive around her [compliments] her voice. As sweet as a Rossogola, as perfect as a pakora, as charming as the smile on her face and every other thing nice :)”",
