Upon the child removing all of the pumpkin pulp from both cavities, which was a rather tedious, but, overall, engaging event for the whole onlooking village, they'd yell out the emphatic line in their triumph.\n\n'Thou holes may be foul and rich in ferment, but no evil spirit shall have my newly claimed festive bit of nourishment! Whether sweet or sour, if it takes me more than an hour, no seeds there shall be, as you can now see, two gaping holes abound, we can now share in glee, feast we will on the plunder, evil spirits have met their thunder.'\n\nSo, 'doing the pumpkins' referred to a lovely gathering and seasonal time of fellowship, the first known reference of a DP, a rather ironic deviance from traditional Puritan [values] of chastity, loyalty, and resisting temptations of the flesh, as well as the embracing of food fetishes and butt play.",

For an unfathamoble and as yet unexplained reason, it was decided the best way to do this would be to masquerade as a [football team].\n\nThis left County with a problem, as fielding a team with 42 legs went against League regulations. Attempts to get around this by removing the rear legs of each sheep proved a rash and unpopular solution, as not only could the sheep not play football, it also made intercourse far more difficult for the good citizens of Derby.\n\nAxed from the group and traumatised by their experiences, yet unwilling to go quietly, the sheep went on to form the Derby County Supporters Club. Their influence can still be seen today in the delusional, stubborn and sexually maladjusted Derby fans.\n\nReplaced with nine [mental institution] outpatients and a cauliflower, County became masters of irony. Famous gags include being [the holders] of the 'worst Premiership season ever' title while simultaneously performing their shows at a venue known as 'Pride Park' and their ability to charge inbred Derby residents exorbitant prices for one dire [performance] after another.",
