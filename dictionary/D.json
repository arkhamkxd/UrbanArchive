It doesn't necessarily have a plot, it's basically about the [last day of school] at a high school in a small town in Texas in 1976. The soon-to-be seniors are initiating the soon-to-be freshmen, a few friends are trying to get Aerosmith tickets, and everyone is trying to party or get stoned, drunk, or laid. Oh yeah, Dazed and Confused is definitely a cult classic, and a movie I could watch easily over a million times. Even though it's about [the END of the school year], it's still fun to watch whenever. Oh, and Slater is my favorite character by far. The soundtrack is AWESOME as well, featuring songs by: Aerosmith, Foghat, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, War, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, KISS, Steve Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\r\n\r\nThis is, hands down, one of the greatest teen movies ever made. People who grew up in the 70's claim this movie captures the time perfectly, and this movie is definitely a must see. It'll make every young viewer wish they were there partying and having a good time, and every adult remember the good times they had during their teenage years. So, if you're looking for an [entertaining] flick to watch or want a flick that you AND your buddies will enjoy, check out \"Dazed and Confused\".",

For an unfathamoble and as yet unexplained reason, it was decided the best way to do this would be to masquerade as a [football team].\n\nThis left County with a problem, as fielding a team with 42 legs went against League regulations. Attempts to get around this by removing the rear legs of each sheep proved a rash and unpopular solution, as not only could the sheep not play football, it also made intercourse far more difficult for the good citizens of Derby.\n\nAxed from the group and traumatised by their experiences, yet unwilling to go quietly, the sheep went on to form the Derby County Supporters Club. Their influence can still be seen today in the delusional, stubborn and sexually maladjusted Derby fans.\n\nReplaced with nine [mental institution] outpatients and a cauliflower, County became masters of irony.
