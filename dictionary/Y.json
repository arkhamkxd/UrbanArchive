She wont be offended when you tell her “fuck you”, she would just say “thanks a lot 🙂🙃” . She isn’t scared to take risks and would stand up for her true friends. She is caring, playful and humorous. She is weird and weird people are the BEST kinds of people. Don’t call her normal coz she doesn’t like being called normal and night rip your throat out. She’s a hella [dirty minded] and can make you [dirty minded] too. Works for the Illuminati but doesn’t tell anyone. Has the weirdest, most abnormal laugh ever (that will make you laugh too)",
