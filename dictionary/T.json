Trauma claimers insist they and ONLY they can define what trauma is, and demand YOU accept it.\n\nTrauma claimers expect instant support despite their trauma olympics claims and instantly validate the \"trauma\" of others. Discord and tiktok enable this.\n\nIf challenged, trauma claimers vent [narcissistic] rage, show childishness, a sense of entitlement, and insensitivity towards people with PTSD. They attack traumat survivors eg calling them privileged for having their PTSD diagnosed. Fear of conflict and fake-claiming is used in order to redefine reality and drive away others.\n\nTrauma claimers have no interest in healing, support sites or [mental health]. They will ask rape victims for help with the \"[flashbacks]\" of a movie trailer they **chose** to watch yesterday.\n\nTrauma claimers spread harmful myths about [mental health] treatment discouraging others from using it. They probably do need [mental health] help - just not for their fake traumas. Some may have distressing, untreated maladaptive daydreaming instead.",
      "example": "Yesterday Alex, a trauma claimer, said watching a Netflix trailer was \"trauma\" so bad that she had created a new [personality] to cope with it, despite the fact people with DID ([multiple personalities]) have called her on this and said it's not possible. Last week she claimed PTSD from struggling to find a [parking space]! Alex was furious when I suggested mental health support and avoiding trailers. Alex is a trauna claimer who is always looking for another ***enabler***.",

  "The Clarks": [
    {
      "defid": 1969000,
      "definition": "The Clarks are a rock band from Connellsville, PA, a town located about 60 miles from Pittsburgh.  All of [the original] members- vocalist Scott Blasey, guitarist Robert James, bassist Greg Joseph, and drummer Dave Minarik- are still involved.  A very traditional guitar driven rock band, with excellent beats and [introspective] lyrics, The Clarks have been a favorite in Pittsburgh for years, but have had trouble finding a market [outside] of the Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Buffalo area.  The band was formed when members met at Indiana [University] of PA in 1986.  The record their 1st album 'I'll Tell You What, Man' in 1988, which included 'Help Me Out,' a hit on Western PA college rock stations.  The Clarks got their break after releasing thier eponymous 2nd album in 1991.  'Penny On The Floor' was picked up by WDVE, Pittsburgh's biggest rock station, and soon became a Western PA hit, setting the groundwork for the band's successful future.  Album number 3, 'Love Gone Sour, Suspision, And Bad Debt,' following 1994.  Pittsburgh classics 'Cigarette' and 'Treehouse' were included on the album.  Following this albums regional success, The Clarks signed a national recording contract with MCA and appeared to be headed to [the big time].  When The Clarks released their 4th album, 'Someday Maybe,' in 1996, it appeared that national success was on the horizon.  However, MCA was going through a [financial crisis] at the time and the album recieved little promotion.  The Clarks, along with many bands, were cut from the label in 1997.  However, they still had much local success in Pittsburgh with 'Mercury' and 'Stop' and 'Caroline.'  After [taking some time] to regroup, The Clarks released what was prehaps their greatest work.  Their 5th record, 2000's 'Let It Go' captivated audiences.  'Better Off Without You' and 'Born Too Late,' 2 songs that easily could have had national appeal, dominated Pittsburgh radio, while the title track 'Let It Go' and 'Chasin' Girls' also gained regional success.  This album allowed The Clarks to spread the fan base.  While the band could still only be heard in Pittsburgh [for the most part], Cleveland, Buffalo, and Central PA rock stations began spinning songs from 'Let It Go.'  Their 6th album, 'Another Happy Ending' from 2002, featured the powerfully emotional 'Hey You,' which actually gave the band some very, very minor national airplay, mostly on indie shows.  But none the less, this single got the band's name out there, while it and the other popular tracks, 'On Saturday' and 'Boys Lie,' kept up interest at home.  The band's most recent and 7th studio album, 'Fast Moving Cars' continued the string of local hits with 'Hell On Wheels,' 'Shimmy Low,' and the title track 'Fast Moving Cars.'  In 2006, a [greatest hits] compilation was released, which included another single 'Bona Fide.'  While national fame has always eluded them, the Clarks have been rocking Pittsburgh for 20 years.  While they may not be one of the biggest rock bands in the world, the are deffinatly [one of the most] pure!",
      "example": "The Clarks are the type of band that are able to make a [spectacular] [performance] [no matter what] the venue.  I saw them in front of a huge crowd at the Three Rivers Regatta in Pittsburgh and at the little State Theater in Uniontown PA, and the shows were equally good.",

Some songs [included] the harmonica (played by John), so Paul usually sang those, but occasionally John would switch between vocals and harmonica, like in \"I Should Have Known Better\". George and Ringo had their share of songs, too. I think George's most famous song is \"Here comes the Sun\" and Ringo's most well-known is \"[Yellow Submarine]\".\n\nThe Beatles acted in two movies, chronologically, \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help\". They performed select songs in both.\n\nThe world died a little inside when the Beatles disbanded in 1970. They all started solo careers; Paul starting Wings with his wife Lynda.\n\nJohn was killed in 1980 by Mark David Chapman in front of his home, the Dakota, in New York; George died in 2001 from cancer.

The recipient in hopes to be \"dipped\" will lie on his or her back, with mouth agape. The bearer will then position himself above the other, sure to have removed all lower garments, and will slowly begin to lower himself being mindful to align his penis and testicles to the target mouth. \r\n\r\nNow keep in mind, the man must remain calm, so as not disrupt the delivery. Things could get \"messy\" if one looses his flaccidity. And as for the recipient, a little help is not frowned upon, a simple guiding hand will surely relieve some of the pressure off of the already anxious performer.  \r\n\r\nOkay, now lets get down to business;  the completion. Once you are properly aligned, it is now safe to initiate drop sequence. It is completely up to the dipper how much force is used when entering the said mouth. Assuming there has been verbal agreement, so as not to surprise the recipient and therefore prevent possible clamping. \r\nNow place the entirety of your genitalia into the mouth, get [comfortable], and enjoy \"THE BIG DIPPER.\"\r\n\r\nShort Definition: \r\n\r\nWhen a man dips his [dick and balls] into his partner's mouth.",

The area itself is bounded by [Van] Ness Avenue to the west, Market Street to the southeast, Taylor Street to the east, and Geary Boulevard to the north.  Drugs, street [prostitution], homelessness, and poverty are everyday realities which define this neglected [neighborhood].  Although the neighborhood itself is fiercely steeped in degradation the surrounding areas boast the highest rents in the entire city.  You have Nob Hill to the Tenderloin's north, the Pacific Heights neighborhood to the west, and the [Financial District] directly to the east.  The Tenderloin has  historically been the gateway to more [affordable housing] for immigrants and other downtrodden types, but typically is a haven for the dispossessed.  The origin of the name \"Tenderloin\" stems from the graft collected by the vice squad who patrolled the area, and who were thus able to buy the choicest cuts of beef.  There are many other ideas for why the neighborhood was given this peculiar moniker, but regardless of the explanation they invariably tend to emphasize the neighborhood's seediness and depravity.  Supposedly the neighborhood today is undergoing gentrification, but tell that to the crack dealers [on the corner] and they'll give you a befuddled look because they're mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants from South and Central American countries.  But organizations--like rental kingpins Skyline Realty and their subsidiary Citiapartments--are attempting to \"improve\" the Tenderloin by buying out old apartment buildings, driving out the tenants, and raising the rents astronomically so that only people who can afford pure uncut cocaine can live in them.  If this trend persists then the Tenderloin's boundaries may eventually contract to those 10 blocks that radiate from Market street and include St. Anthony's, Boedekker Park, Chez Paree, and the public toilet across from the New Century.

We have to respect them to keep the peace but every once in a while a war will be initiated. The Birds never attack the Bees they just always attack us.
