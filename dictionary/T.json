For an example, a unicorn or dragon. These are more commonly called Otherkin Therians.\n\nDespite the [usual] Therian wearing either animal, real or not, tails and/or ears, they should not be mistaken for furries, as they are completely different to each other.\n\nTherians, or Therianthropes, are able to 'shift', as well, although not all can. It has been [discovered] that there are eight different kind of shifts that a Therian is able to do. Minus 'physical shifting', which is scientifically [impossible]. These eight shifts are...\n\n1. Mental Shifting\n\n2. Phantom Shifting\n\n3. Dream Shifting\n\n4. Cameo Shifting\n\n5. [Astral Shifting]\n\n6. Sensory Shift\n\n7. Bi-location Shifting\n\n8.

All of [the original] members- vocalist Scott Blasey, guitarist Robert James, bassist Greg Joseph, and drummer Dave Minarik- are still involved.  A very traditional guitar driven rock band, with excellent beats and [introspective] lyrics, The Clarks have been a favorite in Pittsburgh for years, but have had trouble finding a market [outside] of the Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Buffalo area.  The band was formed when members met at Indiana [University] of PA in 1986.  The record their 1st album 'I'll Tell You What, Man' in 1988, which included 'Help Me Out,' a hit on Western PA college rock stations.  The Clarks got their break after releasing thier eponymous 2nd album in 1991.  'Penny On The Floor' was picked up by WDVE, Pittsburgh's biggest rock station, and soon became a Western PA hit, setting the groundwork for the band's successful future.  Album number 3, 'Love Gone Sour, Suspision, And Bad Debt,' following 1994.  Pittsburgh classics 'Cigarette' and 'Treehouse' were included on the album.  Following this albums regional success, The Clarks signed a national recording contract with MCA and appeared to be headed to [the big time].  When The Clarks released their 4th album, 'Someday Maybe,' in 1996, it appeared that national success was on the horizon.  However, MCA was going through a [financial crisis] at the time and the album recieved little promotion.  The Clarks, along with many bands, were cut from the label in 1997.  However, they still had much local success in Pittsburgh with 'Mercury' and 'Stop' and 'Caroline.'  After [taking some time] to regroup, The Clarks released what was prehaps their greatest work.  Their 5th record, 2000's 'Let It Go' captivated audiences.  'Better Off Without You' and 'Born Too Late,' 2 songs that easily could have had national appeal, dominated Pittsburgh radio, while the title track 'Let It Go' and 'Chasin' Girls' also gained regional success.  This album allowed The Clarks to spread the fan base.  While the band could still only be heard in Pittsburgh [for the most part], Cleveland, Buffalo, and Central PA rock stations began spinning songs from 'Let It Go.'  Their 6th album, 'Another Happy Ending' from 2002, featured the powerfully emotional 'Hey You,' which actually gave the band some very, very minor national airplay, mostly on indie shows.  But none the less, this single got the band's name out there, while it and the other popular tracks, 'On Saturday' and 'Boys Lie,' kept up interest at home.  The band's most recent and 7th studio album, 'Fast Moving Cars' continued the string of local hits with 'Hell On Wheels,' 'Shimmy Low,' and the title track 'Fast Moving Cars.'  In 2006, a [greatest hits] compilation was released, which included another single 'Bona Fide.'  While national fame has always eluded them, the Clarks have been rocking Pittsburgh for 20 years.  While they may not be one of the biggest rock bands in the world, the are deffinatly [one of the most] pure!",

      "example": "They all played a variety of instruments. Depending on the tone and beat of the song, either Paul or John would usually sing. The faster beat songs were generally John, and the slower, lovey songs were usually Paul. Some songs [included] the harmonica (played by John), so Paul usually sang those, but occasionally John would switch between vocals and harmonica, like in \"I Should Have Known Better\". George and Ringo had their share of songs, too. I think George's most famous song is \"Here comes the Sun\" and Ringo's most well-known is \"[Yellow Submarine]\".\n\nThe Beatles acted in two movies, chronologically, \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help\". They performed select songs in both.\n\nThe world died a little inside when the Beatles disbanded in 1970. They all started solo careers; Paul starting Wings with his wife Lynda.\n\nJohn was killed in 1980 by Mark David Chapman in front of his home, the Dakota, in New York; George died in 2001 from cancer. Paul and Ringo are still living to this day.

The recipient in hopes to be \"dipped\" will lie on his or her back, with mouth agape. The bearer will then position himself above the other, sure to have removed all lower garments, and will slowly begin to lower himself being mindful to align his penis and testicles to the target mouth. \r\n\r\nNow keep in mind, the man must remain calm, so as not disrupt the delivery. Things could get \"messy\" if one looses his flaccidity. And as for the recipient, a little help is not frowned upon, a simple guiding hand will surely relieve some of the pressure off of the already anxious performer.  \r\n\r\nOkay, now lets get down to business;  the completion. Once you are properly aligned, it is now safe to initiate drop sequence. It is completely up to the dipper how much force is used when entering the said mouth. Assuming there has been verbal agreement, so as not to surprise the recipient and therefore prevent possible clamping. \r\nNow place the entirety of your genitalia into the mouth, get [comfortable], and enjoy \"THE BIG DIPPER.\"\r\n\r\nShort Definition: \r\n\r\nWhen a man dips his [dick and balls] into his partner's mouth.",

The area itself is bounded by [Van] Ness Avenue to the west, Market Street to the southeast, Taylor Street to the east, and Geary Boulevard to the north.  Drugs, street [prostitution], homelessness, and poverty are everyday realities which define this neglected [neighborhood].  Although the neighborhood itself is fiercely steeped in degradation the surrounding areas boast the highest rents in the entire city.  You have Nob Hill to the Tenderloin's north, the Pacific Heights neighborhood to the west, and the [Financial District] directly to the east.  The Tenderloin has  historically been the gateway to more [affordable housing] for immigrants and other downtrodden types, but typically is a haven for the dispossessed.  The origin of the name \"Tenderloin\" stems from the graft collected by the vice squad who patrolled the area, and who were thus able to buy the choicest cuts of beef.  There are many other ideas for why the neighborhood was given this peculiar moniker, but regardless of the explanation they invariably tend to emphasize the neighborhood's seediness and depravity.  Supposedly the neighborhood today is undergoing gentrification, but tell that to the crack dealers [on the corner] and they'll give you a befuddled look because they're mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants from South and Central American countries.  But organizations--like rental kingpins Skyline Realty and their subsidiary Citiapartments--are attempting to \"improve\" the Tenderloin by buying out old apartment buildings, driving out the tenants, and raising the rents astronomically so that only people who can afford pure uncut cocaine can live in them.  If this trend persists then the Tenderloin's boundaries may eventually contract to those 10 blocks that radiate from Market street and include St. Anthony's, Boedekker Park, Chez Paree, and the public toilet across from the New Century.

The values of the Bird Cult are simple Love, Peace, Hard work, and Respect [For The Birds]. There is only one thing we do not approve of... Bees. We have to respect them to keep the peace but every once in a while a war will be initiated. The Birds never attack the Bees they just always attack us. Like I said the Birds have values and one of them is Peace. We always respect the warriors who die. On a different note there is a language in the works for the Bird Cult.

The book was published in 1936.\r\n\r\n*Context*\r\n______________________________\r\nPrior  to [the Great Depression], opinions about how to properly manage the economy were dominated by Neoclassical economics, which advocated little [government intervention].  In particular, unemployment was regarded as the consequence of workers failing to accept [wages] sufficiently low to permit full employment.\r\n\r\nDuring [the Great Depression], unemployment soared to 25% in the USA and Germany.  Economics had no advice to give to leaders anxious to do something, and none of the neoclassical predictions were coming true.    The government of the UK commissioned J.M. Keynes to lead a commission of top British economists in a general review of economic theory; their finding were summarized by Keynes in *The General Theory*.\r\n\r\n*The Findings*\r\n______________________________\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge team did not have access to statistics of national income and product accounting (NIPA). They did have some data on unemployment and prices, especially from the USA.  \r\n\r\nKeynes also identified several inherent logical problems with neoclassical economic theory about saving and investment.  The theory said that all economic output of an economy would tend to be consumed; all saving would be invested; and all workers would be employed, *provided wages fell low enough*.    \r\n\r\n\r\nKeynes noted the economic mechanism by which investment occurs has little to do with the existing rate of saving; both are influenced by interest rates, but other forces come into play (e.g., [liquidity preference] for saving, business opportunities and user cost for investment).  Hence, aggregate demand can drift very far out of alignment with output (or potential output).\r\n\r\nAnother finding was that employment rates actually did not respond in a [predictable] way to the fall in wages.  The US economy suffered periods when a reduction in the wage level lead to increases in employment, despite the assumption that workers would have withdrawn from the labor market. \r\n\r\nFinally, Keynes proposed the use of monetary policy and fiscal policy for regulating business cycles.",

Each player gets to choose a \"primary card\", which they will hold on to throughout the game.  Players place the card face-up in front of them.  Reshuffle any extra cards back into the deck.  \r\n\r\nChoose a [designated] dealer to keep things less [confusing], and give this player the deck.  Moving clockwise, the dealer will address \"guessers\" one at a time.  \r\n\r\nThe guesser will be issued a \"secondary card\", which will be placed next to (not on top of) the primary card.  However, the guesser has the optional choice of guessing the suite of that card before it is placed down.  If the guess is correct, all other players (including dealer) are charged one drink (usually a sip) and the guesser gets to discard his secondary cards (giving him only one card for a round).\r\n\r\n[Furthermore], the secondary card that is placed down becomes the \"indicator\" card.  If any players have a primary or secondary card that matches in suite OR number value, they will take a drink for each match.\r\n\r\nIf only one of your cards match the secondary card that was just placed down, you take one drink (fuck!).  If both match, you take two ([double fuck]!), but if the guesser correctly guessed the card's suite AND you have two matches, you take three drinks (triple fuck!).  \r\n\r\nAfter a round, everyone should have a primary and secondary card.  Continue [going around], placing new secondary cards on top of old secondary cards.",

Riki guesses his next card to be a diamond, and it [turns out] to be a 9 of spades (9s), which becomes his new secondary card.  Anyone with 9s or spades will drink.  Riki takes a drink for having a spade (As), Jacob takes one drink for having the spades (2s), and Alex takes one drink for having a 9 (9h).\r\n\r\nRiki: As / 2s  (dealer)\r\nEric: 6h / Qc\r\nJacob: 2s / Jc\r\nAlex: 9h / 3d\r\n\r\nNow, Eric guesses, but he noticed that Riki has two spades (As and 2s).

[The card] miraculously [turns out] to be an 8 of spades!  \r\n\r\nRiki gets [the triple] fuck, so he takes three drinks (one because Eric correctly guessed, and one for each suite match).
