Basically if each and every one of the group doesn't have ID then none of them will get served.\n\nBoth of these scenarios are typical of [Wetherspoons] as they are well known for being extremely strict when it comes to asking for ID and they do not [appreciate] one bit any scummy underagers on their premises getting boozed up under any [circumstances].",
