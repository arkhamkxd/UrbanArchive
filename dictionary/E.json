Despite what a person has been through, this feeling continues to remain in their heart, no matter what.\n\nChris Martin was inspired to write a song based off of the word while at a beach. \"I was in the ocean one day with this surfer guy, who spoke just like you'd imagine a surfer guy to speak … This guy spoke like Sean Penn's character from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He was like, ['Yo] dude, I was doing this thing [the other day] man, it gave me this total everglow!'\n\n\"I was like, 'What an amazing word.' Then the song came completely out, and to me, it's about – whether it's a loved one or a situation or a friend or a [relationship] that's finished or someone's passed away – I was really thinking about, after you've been through the sadness of something, you also get this everglow.\"\n\n-Chris Martin (Sources: [Rolling Stone] and Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show)",
