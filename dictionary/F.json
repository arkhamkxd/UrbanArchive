Known for their nasal vocalist, simplistic guitar riffs, basslines consisting of no more than four notes which cannot even be successfully played at a live show, and \"poetic\" lyrics such as \"WE'RE GOIN\" DOWN, DOWN, ENALURBLYURAAHLL...\", it's no surprise that Fall Out Boy is [one of the most] popular rock acts today, [particularly] among 14-21 year old females and males confused about their [orientation].\r\n\r\nFall Out Boy differs from similar bands in that their bassist acts as (or tries to act as) the frontman of the group, without singing or adequately playing his instrument. Though he ranks as the least talented member of the band, Pete Wentz garners most of the group's media attention, being the only 6 while surrounded by 3's and 4's. Pete also writes the \"brilliant lyrics\" indecipherably crooned by singer [Patrick Stump]. In an attempt to appear quirky and clever, titles of Fall Out Boy songs are usually a sentence long. The exposure of Wentz' [genitalia] is irrelevent and was likely brought to the media forefront by the band itself as a failed publicity stunt.\r\n\r\nTaking note of the band's lack of... everything, it is a mystery how Fall Out Boy is successfully marketed. There are no timeless hooks, no [particularly] attractive band members to get the teenyboppers riled up, nothing instrumentally impressive or innovative, and nothing that hasn't been done before several times (and with less ego) by Blink 182 or even Simple Plan. The success of Fall Out Boy remains an enigma, as well as a trademark of the tastelessness of teenage youth and anyone who refers to themself as emo.",
