It is the foundation of all [quantum physics] including quantum chemistry, [quantum field theory], quantum technology, and quantum information science. It is provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black-body radiation and the stability of the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures. This is the hardest part of physics since you are able to create many advanced, high tech things.",
