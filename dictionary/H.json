Thus, if you live in an area with a high density of hipsters, the stores, restaurants, etc. will tend to reflect their tastes/lifestyle. Interestingly, despite being the trendiest of trends, [neighborhoods] that have suffered from hipsterism have generally increased in property value.\n\nHipsters frequently dress in the same general manner, despite describing that manner has being unique/individual. This usually includes vintage clothing, clothing from thrift stores, ironic clothing, plaid, tight pants, metro-sexual clothing, clothing meant to appear ragged/poor (despite it's wearer being middle to upper-middle class and receiving all their money from wealthy parents in the form of an allowance, rather than working/living in reality), etc. They may also wear [unnecessary] accessories such as scarves during the summer, sunglasses indoors, etc.\n\nHipsters are also associated with indie music, [contemporary art], etc. [Unfortunately], their attempts to turn away from the mainstream and \"kitsch\" to a more bohemian-like lifestyle has ruined much of what they now claim as theirs (ie: indie music is now dominated by a scene and has little to do with the actual music, [contemporary art] is plagued with over dramatic plays and poor work/weak conceptual ideas, coffee shop atmospheres are ruined by their judgmental attitude towards all non-hipsters, etc.) In essence, the things they helped to build have lost all value and meaning, but that is appropriate to the apathetic, lack of originality that is possessed by all hipsters.\n\nKnowing the truth about what they are, most hipsters will deny that they are a hipster. However, it should be noted, there are some people who fit the hipster [description] and are legitimate in their interests, activities, and lifestyle, but this is extremely rare.\n\nDespite their likely denials of being a hipster, and a belief in rugged [individuality] (which has turned into a conformity apart from \"mainstream conformity\"), to be a hipster, one must win the approval of other hipsters. Thus, it is impossible for a naturally \"non-coo\" person to ever achieve hipster status. This of course, is yet another [contradiction]. Over all, hipsters lead a judgmental, elitist lifestyle, as aforementioned, with a strong conviction in the belief that they are \"cooler than life.\"\n\nFor some reason, hipsters like Pabst Blue Ribbon, possibly one of the worst, most watered-down beers available... Apparently it's cool to have bad taste, an important detail to [remember] for any aspiring hipster.\n\nIf one is at all unsure of whether a person is in fact a hipster, the yuppie/douche test never fails.

To blame this issue on the fact that someone has school at home makes the problem worse altogether, i.e., it's like dousing a house that is under no danger of burning down with gallons of water, only to realize that the house right next to it is collapsing in flames... attacking something that isn't the cause of the problem. \r\n\r\nI, myself am homeschooled and, quite frankly, have more friends than the average [public schooler] (a good 70% of my friends are public-schoolers, mind you). \r\n     I know about more music (meaning many different bands) than the average public-schooler. \r\n     Among my favorite places to shop for clothes are [American Eagle], Buckle, [Banana Republic], Guess, Gap and Target (don't jump on my case.

      "definition": "A homosexual is someone who prefers the same sex over the [opposite sex]. Now many Bible Pushers will tell you that the Bible says being a homosexual is a sin. Let me clarify for these people who take the words literally [off the page]. God doesn't hate homosexuals. He loves all his children. What he hates is LUST. The Bible talks about hetero lust more than it talks about homo lust. For instance, say a man sees a woman walking down the street and he goes in his mind \"[Ooh] she's fuckin' sexy I wanna get a [piece of that]\" that is lust. If a man sees another man and thinks the same thing, IT IS STILL LUST. Now if a man falls in love with another man and they both care deeply for each other, the two of them getting physical is okay. It's not ok when there isn't any love involved but just the desire to have sex with another man. Same thing goes for lesbians. So it isn't wrong. Christians need to stop taking the words on the pages of the Bible literally and learn to think!",
      "example": "Matilda fell in love with her [best friend] Kathy and was happy to find out Kathy felt the same about her.\n\nLust in any form is a sin, but all love is smiled upon by God.\n\n[It's okay] to be in a homosexual [relationship] if there isn't lust involved.",

I believe it evolved from the 'emo' , 'hardcore' scene but can now be seen at most any show you go to where heavy music is played.  I would assume the reason for [this is that] recently, most styles of metal have crossed and blended into eachother. \r\n\r\nThis makes for some great music, but the 'Hardcore Dancing' is possibly the lamest, most [retarded thing] Ive ever seen.  Its basically a person who looks like he never lifted a weight in his life flailing his harms and doing spin kicks as if he were fighting a barrage of invisible attackers.  They seem to have no regard for anyone around them, as most times this 'dancing' will take place in the middle of a club that's packed shoulder to shoulder and several onlookers will get hit 'by accident'.\r\nWhile I still see it as a valid form of expression, the middle of a crowd is not the place to do it!  To make matters even more ridiculous, most of these kids seem to be pansies.  Crack head thin or haneously [out of shape], they walk around like they're a bunch of badasses and then suddenly break out into a 'dance' that looks like [Jackie Chan] having an epilleptic seizure. \r\n\r\nIf the dancing were choreographed, or at least followed the music to any degree it might look [pretty cool]...sad thing is Im sure some of these guys are really trying to do that but the poser fairy ninja wannabes ruin the whole scene for them.\r\n\r\nThe best part is, if anyone actually jumps [in the pit] and tries to 'mosh' the way it should be done, they run for the sidelines like the pussies they are.\r\n\r\nCompared to old school 'moshing', where people would headbang and shove eachother, a 'hardcore dancing' pit seems much more malicious.  In a mosh pit, if someone fell down or got hit by accident people would generally stop, pick the person up, get him out of the pit, etc. In a hardcore dancing area, bystanders are getting punched and kicked,etc.  Just last night I was at an InFlames concert and some 120lb punk in a wife beater gave me a roundhouse to the arm while i was trying to [watch the show].  I went in after him and he ran away!! \r\n\r\nHardcore dancing could actually evolve into a cool form of self-expression.  However, [for the most part] its sissy-bitch weaklings who think [its cool] to act like a bunch of morons and hurt people at metal shows.\r\n\r\nThe people who are really into hardcore dancing and are trying to take it to another level should really reign in the shitheads, as they're ruining the scene for everybody.",

It is most commonly associated with pool (and to an extent other billiards-family games), but also can be performed with regard to other sports and gambling activities. Hustlers may also engage in \"sharking\" ‚Äì [distracting], disheartening, enraging or even threatening their opponents, to throw them off. Hustlers are thus often called \"pool sharks\" (compare \"card shark\"). [Professional] and semi-pro hustlers sometimes work with a \"stakehorse\" ‚Äî a person who provides the money for the hustler to bet with (and who may assist in the hustling) ‚Äî in exchange for a substantial portion of all winnings. Another form of hustling (often [engaged] in by the same hustlers who use the skill-disguising technique) is challenging \"marks\" (swindle targets) to bet on trick shots that seem near-impossible but at which the hustler is exceptionally skilled.",

About 98% of the kids drink or smoke.

You will most likely start to space out for what seems like forever and then instantly realize how disconnected you are. At this point you then turn to your friend and tell them what you just told them and they will reply, \"DUDE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN!\" or they will stare at you blakly for a few seconds and then start to laugh their ass off. Then comes the [uncontrollable] laughing fits at almost nothing or at nothing itself. All music you hear will sound like the clearest and best quality music you have ever heard. Also, when you watch movies you get sort of a tunnel vision and it seems like you're in a movie theater. Another thing is that just your normal vision will seem like the quality has shot way up and even the difference in color of leaves in fall will make you be completely and utterly in bliss with how beautiful every thing is.

The term \"hot coffee\" comes from the fact that, if the girlfriend enjoys herself on her date, she will invite you back to her house for \"coffee.\"\r\n\r\nBecame a controversy due to [Hillary Clinton], who called for a House vote urging the Federal Trade Commission to step in and investigate the Rockstar Entertainment \"scandal.\"  Since this happened, the ESRB has re-rated GTA:SA with an Adults Only (AO) rating (as opposed to the original Mature (M) rating), meaning that the game is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.  This has caused stores like Best Buy and Wal Mart to yank the game off of shelves, as most electronics stores have a policy that does not allow the sale of AO games.\r\n\r\nTo add to the irony, law suits are now starting to rise from independent consumers who supposedly bought the game for their children (who were under the age of 17), claiming that they thought that the game was rated M and not AO (the age difference between an M and AO game is one year).",

Many people born the 1950-60's were part of the rags-to-riches generation. Many people invested in the property market, as it made many many people rich. This is how many could afford to immigrate to other countries. The property market peaked at early 1998, and crashed, thanks to the new [Chinese government]. This left many people bankrupt and unable to leave. Under British rule, Hong Kong set the example for the world as government no other interference with its people except to keep the law. China signed a 99-year lease to Britian, and was forced to hand Hong Kong back to China on July 1. 1997. \r\n\r\n[Unfortunately], Hong Kong is very small and many land is reclaimed.  Also went through a major change in [infrastructure] with the new airport built in 1998. However, pre-1998 the airport was located in the heart of Hong Kong and was known for its breathtaking landings beside high-rise skyscrapers. Many of the \"rags-to-riches\" generation left Hong Kong for North America (mostly Canada) mostly between 1989-1997 (between Tianmen Square and the handover). People in Hong Kong are EXTREMELY hard working, students are under tremendous pressure to do well, and that is the reason many came to Canada, for a better life and a less stressful school life. The skyline of Hong Kong changes each year, as more and more buildings are put up and the old ones are being demolished. [Public transportation] is VERY efficient with the MTR system. The Airport Express stands out of the already world-class system. One of the landmarks of Hong Kong is the Tsing Ma Bridge, the world-class airport, its famous Victoria Skyline and the Peak. Also, Disneyland Hong Kong will be built in Fall 2005, be sure to visit it!",

Hating is much more than just being jealous of the person who has done well.  The hater would find much satisfaction in seeing some form of misfortune come to that person.  \r\n\r\nHaters may also simply find satisfaction in someone else‚Äôs misfortune. When a friend falls off a bicycle and lands in the sewer for instance, it is a normal reaction to laugh at the situation.  However, a hater will respond slightly differently by laughing at the person in a ridiculing manner. \r\n\r\nHaters have a special link to one another and they tend to fuel each others hate by hating in groups.  It may be a form of stress relief or something entirely different but they do seem to become happy from the escalation of hate for a person that arises in these groups.  \r\n\r\nHaters generally tend to hate people who are doing well even more so - racists excluded - if they are closer or more similar to them or of a similar social class.  \r\n\r\nWhen Jesus talked about prophets not being welcome in their own home town, he was probably talking about the haters. \r\n\r\nThere is one African tribe that used to be famous for hating its best hunters.  A great hunter would make the biggest catch in months for instance, and then everybody would put him down by telling him that they couldn‚Äôt believe that he could expect them to eat something so puny and unhealthy looking.\r\n\r\nHowever, hating is by no means limited to Africa.  Hating exists all [around the world].  Among travellers for instance, Anglo-saxons from the UK, US and Australia are famous for hating, especially when a non [anglo-saxon] is doing well.  This reputation is likely the result of a handful of haters that make a bad name for every [Anglo-saxon], and even citizens of these nations who are not even [anglo-saxon].",

Masked as ethically progressive frameworks, they enforce artificial scarcity of authentic connections, driving competitive commodification.

They have boot feet, buck-teeth, heart noses, and Pac-Man eyes. All of them have thin lines located on their philtrum, between the nose and mouth. [According to] MrRockGuy who gave a definition to this in June 2004, they die in horribly violent accidents and situations, and this is actually true too sometimes! However, mostly when they get hurt, they will make noises ranging from screams to whimpers, and depict injuries as well. Mostly, there is no blood in the injuries, but some bleeding, to make sure it's [appropriate] for children. These animals behave mostly like children, seeking people to play with. Even though they can get bored too, they are also kept as pets [according to] Statistics Canada. Some of them have cheeks too; a few of them have freckles, [gapped] teeth, and antlers if they're a moose. They can sing, speak clear English and gibberish, and dance.\n\nAccording to Animal Planet, they are usually found in cities and towns, even in rural places. As well as that, they can even be found in America too! If a tree friend appears as an anteater, the animal has NO BUCKTEETH OR NOSE, just a trunk.",

He also targeted egirls, often accusing them of leading men on for financial gain. Hoksi would then release their [personal information] and sensitive data, such as their social security numbers and addresses, causing them to receive [death threats] and harassment from his followers.\n\nHowever, Hoksi's actions were not without consequences. He was eventually arrested and charged with several crimes, including hacking and extortion. His actions also highlighted the dangers of vigilantism and the potential harm it can cause to innocent individuals who are falsely accused.\n\nWhile Hoksi may have had good intentions, his actions were ultimately harmful and did not address the root causes of these issues.
