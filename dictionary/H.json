A hand release can also be done on a woman by stimulating her clitoris to produce an orgasm.\r\n\r\nA hand release after a massage is called a “happy ending”. A release before a massage is called a “happy beginning”.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of hand releases. The most common is the “hand job” – stroking of the penis to produce orgasm. A “French” release is a blow job. A “Swedish” or “Russian” is a release done between a woman’s [large breasts].\r\n\r\nHand releases on males are usually done after the massage – the therapist uses a lubricating solution to stimulate the erect sexual organ. Massage oil or cream is usually used, but other sexual water based lubricants, such as Astroglide or KY Jelly can be used. \r\n\r\nInstitutions that are involved with massage education and licensing are very much against hand release during a massage session because in many places it is illegal and can be termed as a form of [prostitution]. However, it is very hard to arrest a masseuse or masseur for [giving a hand] release; and although the act of hand release is considered illegal it is rarely if never found out by the legal or licensing [authorities].\r\n\r\nLicensed massage therapists usually don’t do hand releases because of legal or ethical reasons, but there are many [professional] who don’t see anything wrong with them and will gladly do them once they get to know you better or for an extra fee. Massage therapists have to be very careful when they offer a hand release out of fear of being caught and arrested by an undercover police officer. This is rare though.",
