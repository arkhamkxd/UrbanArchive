Thus, if you live in an area with a high density of hipsters, the stores, restaurants, etc. will tend to reflect their tastes/lifestyle. Interestingly, despite being the trendiest of trends, [neighborhoods] that have suffered from hipsterism have generally increased in property value.\n\nHipsters frequently dress in the same general manner, despite describing that manner has being unique/individual. This usually includes vintage clothing, clothing from thrift stores, ironic clothing, plaid, tight pants, metro-sexual clothing, clothing meant to appear ragged/poor (despite it's wearer being middle to upper-middle class and receiving all their money from wealthy parents in the form of an allowance, rather than working/living in reality), etc. They may also wear [unnecessary] accessories such as scarves during the summer, sunglasses indoors, etc.\n\nHipsters are also associated with indie music, [contemporary art], etc. [Unfortunately], their attempts to turn away from the mainstream and \"kitsch\" to a more bohemian-like lifestyle has ruined much of what they now claim as theirs (ie: indie music is now dominated by a scene and has little to do with the actual music, [contemporary art] is plagued with over dramatic plays and poor work/weak conceptual ideas, coffee shop atmospheres are ruined by their judgmental attitude towards all non-hipsters, etc.) In essence, the things they helped to build have lost all value and meaning, but that is appropriate to the apathetic, lack of originality that is possessed by all hipsters.\n\nKnowing the truth about what they are, most hipsters will deny that they are a hipster. However, it should be noted, there are some people who fit the hipster [description] and are legitimate in their interests, activities, and lifestyle, but this is extremely rare.\n\nDespite their likely denials of being a hipster, and a belief in rugged [individuality] (which has turned into a conformity apart from \"mainstream conformity\"), to be a hipster, one must win the approval of other hipsters. Thus, it is impossible for a naturally \"non-coo\" person to ever achieve hipster status. This of course, is yet another [contradiction]. Over all, hipsters lead a judgmental, elitist lifestyle, as aforementioned, with a strong conviction in the belief that they are \"cooler than life.\"\n\nFor some reason, hipsters like Pabst Blue Ribbon, possibly one of the worst, most watered-down beers available... Apparently it's cool to have bad taste, an important detail to [remember] for any aspiring hipster.\n\nIf one is at all unsure of whether a person is in fact a hipster, the yuppie/douche test never fails.

While there are many homeschoolers whom would be considered nerds by most, to say that all homeschoolers are nerds or non-sociable is a hasty generalization.\r\n \r\nIn truth, looking at [public schools], there are essentially the same amount of nerds and introverts. The problem of lacking social skills is not an issue of the school you choose to go to; it is simply a problem of a [personality] that one must work to get rid of. \r\n\r\nA lack of social skills is unhealthy for nearly everyone. To blame this issue on the fact that someone has school at home makes the problem worse altogether, i.e., it's like dousing a house that is under no danger of burning down with gallons of water, only to realize that the house right next to it is collapsing in flames... attacking something that isn't the cause of the problem. \r\n\r\nI, myself am homeschooled and, quite frankly, have more friends than the average [public schooler] (a good 70% of my friends are public-schoolers, mind you). \r\n     I know about more music (meaning many different bands) than the average public-schooler. \r\n     Among my favorite places to shop for clothes are [American Eagle], Buckle, [Banana Republic], Guess, Gap and Target (don't jump on my case. Target's clothes easily compare to American Eagle's, for sure).\r\n\r\nSo the stereotype condemning homeschoolers is not altogether true. I would admit that it's not absolutely unreasonable. However, I have to say again that homeschoolers are not the issue. It's nerds/introverts/sheltered people in general.",

Let me clarify for these people who take the words literally [off the page]. God doesn't hate homosexuals. He loves all his children. What he hates is LUST. The Bible talks about hetero lust more than it talks about homo lust. For instance, say a man sees a woman walking down the street and he goes in his mind \"[Ooh] she's fuckin' sexy I wanna get a [piece of that]\" that is lust. If a man sees another man and thinks the same thing, IT IS STILL LUST. Now if a man falls in love with another man and they both care deeply for each other, the two of them getting physical is okay. It's not ok when there isn't any love involved but just the desire to have sex with another man. Same thing goes for lesbians. So it isn't wrong. Christians need to stop taking the words on the pages of the Bible literally and learn to think!",

A typical, drug-addicted street [prostitute] will smoke 3.5 grams per day for 3-5 days straight (with no sleep) until the drug, food deprivation and [sleep deprivation] literally drop her. This is why you see street hookers out at ALL times of the day and night - they need 'food' (more crack). The crack 'energizes' her and makes her feel so good again that she is ready to work some more, to get more crack of course. After a while she becomes insensitive to the high and some dealer/user/pimp will teach her how to inject crack with [lemon juice] (or vinegar to neutralize the baking soda in the crack) intervenously, to give her a baseline, then smoking will once again give her a buzz.

      "defid": 1627310,
      "definition": "A form of 'dancing' that is becoming more popular with the younger crowd at metal shows.  I believe it evolved from the 'emo' , 'hardcore' scene but can now be seen at most any show you go to where heavy music is played.  I would assume the reason for [this is that] recently, most styles of metal have crossed and blended into eachother. \r\n\r\nThis makes for some great music, but the 'Hardcore Dancing' is possibly the lamest, most [retarded thing] Ive ever seen.  Its basically a person who looks like he never lifted a weight in his life flailing his harms and doing spin kicks as if he were fighting a barrage of invisible attackers.  They seem to have no regard for anyone around them, as most times this 'dancing' will take place in the middle of a club that's packed shoulder to shoulder and several onlookers will get hit 'by accident'.\r\nWhile I still see it as a valid form of expression, the middle of a crowd is not the place to do it!  To make matters even more ridiculous, most of these kids seem to be pansies.  Crack head thin or haneously [out of shape], they walk around like they're a bunch of badasses and then suddenly break out into a 'dance' that looks like [Jackie Chan] having an epilleptic seizure. \r\n\r\nIf the dancing were choreographed, or at least followed the music to any degree it might look [pretty cool]...sad thing is Im sure some of these guys are really trying to do that but the poser fairy ninja wannabes ruin the whole scene for them.\r\n\r\nThe best part is, if anyone actually jumps [in the pit] and tries to 'mosh' the way it should be done, they run for the sidelines like the pussies they are.\r\n\r\nCompared to old school 'moshing', where people would headbang and shove eachother, a 'hardcore dancing' pit seems much more malicious.  In a mosh pit, if someone fell down or got hit by accident people would generally stop, pick the person up, get him out of the pit, etc. In a hardcore dancing area, bystanders are getting punched and kicked,etc.  Just last night I was at an InFlames concert and some 120lb punk in a wife beater gave me a roundhouse to the arm while i was trying to [watch the show].  I went in after him and he ran away!! \r\n\r\nHardcore dancing could actually evolve into a cool form of self-expression.  However, [for the most part] its sissy-bitch weaklings who think [its cool] to act like a bunch of morons and hurt people at metal shows.\r\n\r\nThe people who are really into hardcore dancing and are trying to take it to another level should really reign in the shitheads, as they're ruining the scene for everybody.",

This has caused stores like Best Buy and Wal Mart to yank the game off of shelves, as most electronics stores have a policy that does not allow the sale of AO games.\r\n\r\nTo add to the irony, law suits are now starting to rise from independent consumers who supposedly bought the game for their children (who were under the age of 17), claiming that they thought that the game was rated M and not AO (the age difference between an M and AO game is one year).",
