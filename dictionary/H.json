      "definition": "A homosexual is someone who prefers the same sex over the [opposite sex]. Now many Bible Pushers will tell you that the Bible says being a homosexual is a sin. Let me clarify for these people who take the words literally [off the page]. God doesn't hate homosexuals. He loves all his children. What he hates is LUST. The Bible talks about hetero lust more than it talks about homo lust. For instance, say a man sees a woman walking down the street and he goes in his mind \"[Ooh] she's fuckin' sexy I wanna get a [piece of that]\" that is lust. If a man sees another man and thinks the same thing, IT IS STILL LUST. Now if a man falls in love with another man and they both care deeply for each other, the two of them getting physical is okay. It's not ok when there isn't any love involved but just the desire to have sex with another man. Same thing goes for lesbians. So it isn't wrong. Christians need to stop taking the words on the pages of the Bible literally and learn to think!",
      "example": "Matilda fell in love with her [best friend] Kathy and was happy to find out Kathy felt the same about her.\n\nLust in any form is a sin, but all love is smiled upon by God.\n\n[It's okay] to be in a homosexual [relationship] if there isn't lust involved.",

I believe it evolved from the 'emo' , 'hardcore' scene but can now be seen at most any show you go to where heavy music is played.  I would assume the reason for [this is that] recently, most styles of metal have crossed and blended into eachother. \r\n\r\nThis makes for some great music, but the 'Hardcore Dancing' is possibly the lamest, most [retarded thing] Ive ever seen.  Its basically a person who looks like he never lifted a weight in his life flailing his harms and doing spin kicks as if he were fighting a barrage of invisible attackers.  They seem to have no regard for anyone around them, as most times this 'dancing' will take place in the middle of a club that's packed shoulder to shoulder and several onlookers will get hit 'by accident'.\r\nWhile I still see it as a valid form of expression, the middle of a crowd is not the place to do it!  To make matters even more ridiculous, most of these kids seem to be pansies.  Crack head thin or haneously [out of shape], they walk around like they're a bunch of badasses and then suddenly break out into a 'dance' that looks like [Jackie Chan] having an epilleptic seizure. \r\n\r\nIf the dancing were choreographed, or at least followed the music to any degree it might look [pretty cool]...sad thing is Im sure some of these guys are really trying to do that but the poser fairy ninja wannabes ruin the whole scene for them.\r\n\r\nThe best part is, if anyone actually jumps [in the pit] and tries to 'mosh' the way it should be done, they run for the sidelines like the pussies they are.\r\n\r\nCompared to old school 'moshing', where people would headbang and shove eachother, a 'hardcore dancing' pit seems much more malicious.  In a mosh pit, if someone fell down or got hit by accident people would generally stop, pick the person up, get him out of the pit, etc. In a hardcore dancing area, bystanders are getting punched and kicked,etc.  Just last night I was at an InFlames concert and some 120lb punk in a wife beater gave me a roundhouse to the arm while i was trying to [watch the show].  I went in after him and he ran away!! \r\n\r\nHardcore dancing could actually evolve into a cool form of self-expression.  However, [for the most part] its sissy-bitch weaklings who think [its cool] to act like a bunch of morons and hurt people at metal shows.\r\n\r\nThe people who are really into hardcore dancing and are trying to take it to another level should really reign in the shitheads, as they're ruining the scene for everybody.",

It is most commonly associated with pool (and to an extent other billiards-family games), but also can be performed with regard to other sports and gambling activities. Hustlers may also engage in \"sharking\" – [distracting], disheartening, enraging or even threatening their opponents, to throw them off. Hustlers are thus often called \"pool sharks\" (compare \"card shark\"). [Professional] and semi-pro hustlers sometimes work with a \"stakehorse\" — a person who provides the money for the hustler to bet with (and who may assist in the hustling) — in exchange for a substantial portion of all winnings. Another form of hustling (often [engaged] in by the same hustlers who use the skill-disguising technique) is challenging \"marks\" (swindle targets) to bet on trick shots that seem near-impossible but at which the hustler is exceptionally skilled.",
