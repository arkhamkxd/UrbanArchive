The Bible talks about hetero lust more than it talks about homo lust. For instance, say a man sees a woman walking down the street and he goes in his mind \"[Ooh] she's fuckin' sexy I wanna get a [piece of that]\" that is lust. If a man sees another man and thinks the same thing, IT IS STILL LUST. Now if a man falls in love with another man and they both care deeply for each other, the two of them getting physical is okay. It's not ok when there isn't any love involved but just the desire to have sex with another man. Same thing goes for lesbians. So it isn't wrong.
