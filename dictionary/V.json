Alone, it may sound silly, but combined with a nifty hand sign, it's unstoppable!\r\n\r\nMake a \"V\" with your index and middle finger and place the tips of your fingers over your eyes ([finger nails] out).  Your nose should be [in the middle] of the V.  Much like the \"I've got my eye's on you\" gesture, but without the follow up pointing. Just a V over your face. with this little move, you can now call your [office buddy] \"vagina face\", and no one will be the wiser!\r\n\r\nForget \"the bird\", give 'em the \"V\"!",
      "example": "Just so my co-worker knows I care, I shoot him the \"V\" for \"Vagina Face\" at [the office] [all the time].  This way, he knows that he's a Vagina Face without all the HR complications that would result in speaking it out loud in front of others.  [The words] need not be said, the hand signal says it all... \"V\" is for Vagina Face!",
