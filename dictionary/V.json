When I say big I mean a bunch of pretentious douches walking around all the time.\n\nThe party scene is run by the sports kids, mainly lacrosse. Virginia-Wesleyan is very diverse, and can be seen by simply walking around campus: from basketball players to lacrosse players baseball players to field hockey players to an insanely good girls softball team randomly. The sports at Virginia Wesleyan always guarantee pretty amazing talent.
