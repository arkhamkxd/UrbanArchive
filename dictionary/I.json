Italians are generally considered attractive, although it is easy for us to get ugly with our hairy tendencies. People are usually on the short side (women 5'2\"-5'6\", men 5'8\"-6'0\"), although they were much shorter during the Roman times. According to a tour guide at the Flavian Ampitheater at Pozzuoli, a 5'5\" man would be considered very tall and gladiator material. Northern and southern Italians tend to have distinctly different norms of appearance. Lighter skin, eyes, and hair are common in the north (think auburn hair with hazel eyes). Black hair, dark brown (or blue!) eyes, and midtone olive skin are common for the south. [Southerners] are generally shorter than their fellow northern countrymen. More on the Mediterranean people: search for \"gracile mediterranid\" for [anthropological] concepts specific to Italy.\n\n[Personality], behavior, and levels of maturity are relevant only on an individual basis and are separate from ethnicity.\n\nItalians at first glance are commonly mistaken for:\r\n‚Ä¢Iranians (especially in California)\r\n‚Ä¢Greeks\r\n‚Ä¢Armenians\r\n‚Ä¢Hispanics",

The four were part of the Keepers: a secret group who guards Ancient Magic from malicious hands, and all of them were concerned, appalled and a bit terrified of what she had done.

Any dissent or questioning of the iCult's marketing is discouraged. Criticism in any form is seen as rebellion.

A documentry on MTV named [Jersey Shore] showed how people live with IFPS, and how harmful it can become to ones mental health. Living IFPS was origanlly suppose to be and episode for TrueLife but MTV recoqnized the seriousness of the issue of IFPS so they decide to make a documentry instead. Symptoms include but are not limited to Violent Behaviors, [Heavy Drinking], and in the worst cases people have been reported to fist pump to death. This sickness should not be ignored if your friends start to seem like they have IFPS you should follow Doctors Orders and not hang out with Douchebags.",
