According to a tour guide at the Flavian Ampitheater at Pozzuoli, a 5'5\" man would be considered very tall and gladiator material. Northern and southern Italians tend to have distinctly different norms of appearance. Lighter skin, eyes, and hair are common in the north (think auburn hair with hazel eyes). Black hair, dark brown (or blue!) eyes, and midtone olive skin are common for the south. [Southerners] are generally shorter than their fellow northern countrymen.
