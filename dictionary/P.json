A penis panic is sometimes a mass hysteria event or panic where males in a population suddenly exhibit symptoms of genital retraction syndrome.\r\n\r\nPenis panics have occurred [around the world], most notably in Africa and Asia. Local beliefs in many instances assert that such syndromes are often fatal. Genital retraction syndrome in Southeast Asia is known as Koro (Malaysian/Indonesian) or Shook yang (suo yang) in Chinese cultures. [Psychological] diagnosis and treatments are under development. It is becoming increasingly clear that these forms of mass hysteria are more common than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is often, but not always, associated with occult belief, such as witchcraft. These panics frequently, but not exclusively, occur in places where access to education—particularly in science and human biology—is limited, or otherwise restricted (for example, when government policies restrict such education).

The only kids to successfully stay up all night while half the kids back at the campsite were spun out and unable to [communicate], making them \"housecats\" in the eyes of the pumas.

Induction to the puma league is difficult because the standards are fairly rigourous. They include being able to keep yourself under control the entire trip to the point where people unaware of your chemical ingestion would be unable to tell that you are in fact watching them liquify and puddle [on the ground] as they talk. Other requirements include a keen wit and [sense of humor] ie. pumas stomachs always hurt the day [after the] trip because they were laughing their asses off the entire time. Puma parties involve eating acid and [cracking jokes]/making idiotic comments to the point where everyone is in stitches with a smile so wide their cheeks hurt. The complete opposite of the inexperienced tripper, pumas despise people who misuse acid and act all spun out and gooft when they trip.
