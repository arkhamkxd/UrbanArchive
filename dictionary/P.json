Strange enough, but then there were the side effects, such as nausea, vertigo, and even night terrors. Stranger still, men in black, supposedly government agents, often visited the machines, giving rise to rumors of a [government mind control] program. A month later after the machine was first spotted, it vanished, along with any evidence of its existence. The only consistency in the story is the name, Polybius.\n\nWild story, but it actually has some basis in fact. Around the same time and place the myth was set, incidents of teens [blacking out] or experiencing similar side effects to the described symptoms after marathons of games such as Asteroids or Tempest, began to crop up. Also, back during that time, Arcades were often the haunts of drug dealers and other participants in illicit activities, resulting in common sightings of Narcotics officers during hours of operation. Finally, the name springs from one of the codenames of Tempest while it was in its beta stages, Polybius.",

To whichever one man she agrees to allow share her life, this one or [another more] her type, well upon their telling her they like her, & her saying she likes him too, & his inviting her to be his partner, her saying [yes], even though heard to fall in love would be exciting, she finds it daunting the idea of becoming a one man's spouse, his of his own should she desire a man's love. She smiles trustingly, sure that for all the [white goods] & tech equipment you make & the looking at the stars the do ..for her being his he'll be [doing the math] for the two, each his own canary bird in the mine. They will tell she's in the same condition as last seen her, & she'll be able to tell if there's anything wrong with any of them by the wobble in the others.\r\nWe say that men have a higher [infidelity] rate. That is not to protect women's honour by not saying \"women take more men off of women than men do women off of men\".

We've learnt\r\nwomen are able to sniff whether a man is married or attached. It's not to take the single fellow. What a woman seeks in a man is his being popular. When a man's not popular he's liable to love her how someone agreed with too much loves a person to their own devices. Looksism hides this.\"\n\n\"Pentamournesty an option, a woman might now opt to visit & adore a set long-term 3-5 seperate men, neither herself bound to any, or any to her, & seeing these infrequently they tell her condition like each a canary in the mine. There'll be no marriage plebiscite. Pentamournesty is [voluntary].\"\n\n\"Pentamournesty inspires the incel, the involuntarily celibate male, to declare we ought not call women who see 3-4 any of all the dozens of names that mean erotic [entertainer] anymore, which one said one after the other means to a woman & what children she has, something much worse no one can prove someone had said. Those words, used passively aggressively to sneakily mean more than what said, obstruct pentamournesty from being a fair option offered women.\"",
