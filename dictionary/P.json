A penis panic is sometimes a mass hysteria event or panic where males in a population suddenly exhibit symptoms of genital retraction syndrome.\r\n\r\nPenis panics have occurred [around the world], most notably in Africa and Asia. Local beliefs in many instances assert that such syndromes are often fatal. Genital retraction syndrome in Southeast Asia is known as Koro (Malaysian/Indonesian) or Shook yang (suo yang) in Chinese cultures. [Psychological] diagnosis and treatments are under development. It is becoming increasingly clear that these forms of mass hysteria are more common than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is often, but not always, associated with occult belief, such as witchcraft. These panics frequently, but not exclusively, occur in places where access to education—particularly in science and human biology—is limited, or otherwise restricted (for example, when government policies restrict such education). Others have been reported [under the influence] of drug use. (Compare with castration anxiety.)",
