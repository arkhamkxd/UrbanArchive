A penis panic is sometimes a mass hysteria event or panic where males in a population suddenly exhibit symptoms of genital retraction syndrome.\r\n\r\nPenis panics have occurred [around the world], most notably in Africa and Asia. Local beliefs in many instances assert that such syndromes are often fatal. Genital retraction syndrome in Southeast Asia is known as Koro (Malaysian/Indonesian) or Shook yang (suo yang) in Chinese cultures. [Psychological] diagnosis and treatments are under development. It is becoming increasingly clear that these forms of mass hysteria are more common than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is often, but not always, associated with occult belief, such as witchcraft. These panics frequently, but not exclusively, occur in places where access to education—particularly in science and human biology—is limited, or otherwise restricted (for example, when government policies restrict such education).

Induction to the puma league is difficult because the standards are fairly rigourous. They include being able to keep yourself under control the entire trip to the point where people unaware of your chemical ingestion would be unable to tell that you are in fact watching them liquify and puddle [on the ground] as they talk. Other requirements include a keen wit and [sense of humor] ie. pumas stomachs always hurt the day [after the] trip because they were laughing their asses off the entire time. Puma parties involve eating acid and [cracking jokes]/making idiotic comments to the point where everyone is in stitches with a smile so wide their cheeks hurt. The complete opposite of the inexperienced tripper, pumas despise people who misuse acid and act all spun out and gooft when they trip.

Often, a polo-douche will wear more than one polo shirt with every shirt's collar popped. This can mean up to about 8 polo shirts on one douchebag. A polo-douche (PD) can be quickly recognized if you see a guy with an obvious fake tan who is wearing sunglasses inside or at night. A person can be a douchebag without being a PD if he does not wear polo shirts, but if said douchebag usually wears polos and missed a day (most likely because he forgot to make his girlfriend do his laundry) he is still classified as a PD. The worst kind of PD's you will ever meet are the PD's from New Jersey (America's garbage dump). These people should be avoided at all costs. There is one other thing to note, although it probably seems like every person wearing a polo shirt is a douchebag and consequently a PD, that is not the case. The other kind of person [you will see] wearing a polo shirt is a nerd. Nerds in polo shirts are easily identified because the buttons on the shirt will be buttoned [all the way up], the collar will not be popped, the shirt will be tucked in, and there will be a [pocket protector] in the shirt's pocket. Avoid these people too.",

It later seen widespread use by Marines & Sailors during WWI. In Filipino (Tagalog) slang, it could refer to a young Prostitute, but in this sense it's roughly a term for a young homosexual man. In Naval-ese at the time, it was akin to calling someone a 'Nancy' or 'Nancy Boy' (the term 'Nancy' was a somewhat [derogatory term] implying that they were feminine, or possibly homosexual) A 'Nancy' being viewed as someone effeminate & worthless. In the years after WWI, it came to mean any Sailor or Marine who wasn't worth his salt, or couldn't/shouldn't [make the cut], someone who was generally a 'shirker', and was never to be found when there was work to be done.\n\nThe word 'Poggy' also comes from the original definition of the word, and the term 'Poggy Bait' refers candy, chocolate, canned rations, ect. or any other snacks or food items that may be used to solicit [prostitutes].\n\nU.S. Army GI's stationed in the [Philippines] also used the word 'Poggy' to refer to female genitalia.

At least Sony guarantees to combat the \"always online requirement\" and \"used game fees\" of that other console *cough*Xbone*cough*.\n\nThe PS4's \"DualShock 4\"[controller] is like all of the other ones that date back to the PS1 . . . with a big ass touch pad [in the middle] and a blue laser on top so players can now pretend that they are in \"Tron.\" And you can now use your $250 Playstation Vita as the controller, too! *Ahem, Wii U?*\n\nThe PS4 supposedly updates the graphics capabilities of the PS3. However, the graphics seem to be the same to the naked eye, [unless] Sony somehow pulled 1081p out of their asses.\n\nAlso, the PS4 is unable to read PS3 disks due to the fact that Sony can't fit the ability into its sandwich console. Instead, most PS3 titles will be streamed out of the crap that is Sony's new Gaikai cloud service. You'll probably need an [internet connection] for that, though *cough*Xbone*cough*.\n\nAt least the PS4 doesn't force all of that other multi-media bullsh*t down our throats like other systems do *cough*Xbone&WiiU*cough*. No one needs to hear about how you can watch ESPN and go on UD with a \"gaming\" console.",

Today they oppress non-Jews, and in the year 2004 the Israelis killed over 450 women and children. In the Six-day War the Israelis were losing to the Arab countries until America came in and threatend to bomb any country opposing Israel. Since 1949 American tax payers have given Israel over $83.205 billion. Mentioned in the Bible as Palestine, and not Israel. Even Pope [John Paul II] refused to recognize Palestine as Israel. Also more that 90% of Jordans population are originally Palestinain, which came to Jordan as a result of the attacks done by the Israelies which resulted in the loss of the Palestinan's land and homes. There are even many Pro-Palestinian [protestors], who are Jewish, in Palestine, who are often arrested and beaten by Israeli officials.\r\nAll of this [information] is factual and could be checked up online.",

There is an abundance of these laws and regulations that benefit only the rich and powerful who can afford to exploit the rewarding opportunities with highly paid advisers to help them.\n\nRepublican Politicism: During the Bush [administration] on the heals of the so-called dot com and tech driven stock bubble bursting, along with an incipient recession and the financially and emotionally [devastating] attacks on [the World Trade Center] of 9/11, ordinary income tax rates were reduced for all and large cuts in capital gains taxes were enacted and preferential taxes such as taxing [performance] based ordinary income of hedge fund managers, not owners, at much lower capital gain rate given to those who put money at risk, was allowed to remain in force. Arguably helpful as a financial stimulus all the while adding to the national deficit, arguably too large and generous but in-arguably beneficial most directly to the rich who do pay most of the taxes.\n\nDemocratic Politicism: HR3200 House Bill to reform health care included a public option to keep the insurance companies honest, by creating government [competition] to the insurance industry. Arguably a [way] to provide [competition] intended to lower insurance costs, arguably a way to eventually create government dominance to phase into a single payer system proponents really want immediately, but in-arguably creating a larger role and likelihood of politicized government control over business in a manner not unlike the government sponsorship of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a duopoly which cornered an intermediary and defining role in the mortgage market for decades as a PRINCIPAL rather than more properly as a facilitator or insurer in a manner similar to the FHA, the VA or the FDIC.",

It blends elisions, [vowel] shifts, and resonance-driven modifications to create a language both ethereal and [enigmatic].\n\nProto-Galactic’s enigmatic nature means that even simple, everyday phrases can be transformed into something musically mysterious. For example, while [the standard] phrase might be “walk in a park,” a Proto-Galactic speaker might render it as:\n\n“þrü leäfzz wi müv a hïdd’n soün.”\n\nHere’s what makes this [transformation] special:\r\n\t•\tPhonetic Play: The sounds are shifted and elided—notice how “þrü” suggests “through” or “tread,” and “leäfzz” invokes a natural, organic quality [reminiscent] of leaves or paths.\r\n\t•\tEnigmatic Layer: Rather than stating the command directly, the phrase hints at a journey or a movement through a hidden, perhaps sacred, natural space—much like a park becomes a realm of subtle mystery.\r\n\t•\tZenigmatic Aesthetic: By altering the phonetics and structure, the phrase encapsulates the overall Zenigmatic vibe—a blend of Zen-like calm and enigma. It’s not just about the literal meaning, but about evoking a mood or state of mind.",
