A penis panic is sometimes a mass hysteria event or panic where males in a population suddenly exhibit symptoms of genital retraction syndrome.\r\n\r\nPenis panics have occurred [around the world], most notably in Africa and Asia. Local beliefs in many instances assert that such syndromes are often fatal. Genital retraction syndrome in Southeast Asia is known as Koro (Malaysian/Indonesian) or Shook yang (suo yang) in Chinese cultures. [Psychological] diagnosis and treatments are under development. It is becoming increasingly clear that these forms of mass hysteria are more common than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is often, but not always, associated with occult belief, such as witchcraft. These panics frequently, but not exclusively, occur in places where access to education—particularly in science and human biology—is limited, or otherwise restricted (for example, when government policies restrict such education). Others have been reported [under the influence] of drug use. (Compare with castration anxiety.)",

In other words, while the pumas raged the entire night the housecats merely sat in their litterboxes, watching universes form and collapse in the palms of their hands and repeating phrases like, \"i'm so spun i can't think\", \"dude please stop melting\" and \"God, is that you?\". \r\nPUMA stands for Psychedelic Users: Masters of Acid. Induction to the puma league is difficult because the standards are fairly rigourous. They include being able to keep yourself under control the entire trip to the point where people unaware of your chemical ingestion would be unable to tell that you are in fact watching them liquify and puddle [on the ground] as they talk. Other requirements include a keen wit and [sense of humor] ie. pumas stomachs always hurt the day [after the] trip because they were laughing their asses off the entire time. Puma parties involve eating acid and [cracking jokes]/making idiotic comments to the point where everyone is in stitches with a smile so wide their cheeks hurt. The complete opposite of the inexperienced tripper, pumas despise people who misuse acid and act all spun out and gooft when they trip. Housecats beware, when the puma league rolls through you will be nothing more than fodder to be feasted upon by the hungry pumas. nobody rages like a puma, bitch",
      "example": "John Dirt, sMack assiter, [the easter bunny], and Scooter were up all [night tripping] and laughing their asses off. The next morning they all felt as though they had done 300 sit ups because their abs were so sore from laughing; that's the puma shit [right there].",

This douchebag will always be wearing a polo shirt usually of Abercrombie or Hollister origins. 99% of the time the collar on the d-bag's shirt will be \"popped\" making the douchebag look like [even] more of a complete tool. Often, a polo-douche will wear more than one polo shirt with every shirt's collar popped. This can mean up to about 8 polo shirts on one douchebag. A polo-douche (PD) can be quickly recognized if you see a guy with an obvious fake tan who is wearing sunglasses inside or at night. A person can be a douchebag without being a PD if he does not wear polo shirts, but if said douchebag usually wears polos and missed a day (most likely because he forgot to make his girlfriend do his laundry) he is still classified as a PD. The worst kind of PD's you will ever meet are the PD's from New Jersey (America's garbage dump). These people should be avoided at all costs. There is one other thing to note, although it probably seems like every person wearing a polo shirt is a douchebag and consequently a PD, that is not the case. The other kind of person [you will see] wearing a polo shirt is a nerd. Nerds in polo shirts are easily identified because the buttons on the shirt will be buttoned [all the way up], the collar will not be popped, the shirt will be tucked in, and there will be a [pocket protector] in the shirt's pocket. Avoid these people too.",

It later seen widespread use by Marines & Sailors during WWI. In Filipino (Tagalog) slang, it could refer to a young Prostitute, but in this sense it's roughly a term for a young homosexual man. In Naval-ese at the time, it was akin to calling someone a 'Nancy' or 'Nancy Boy' (the term 'Nancy' was a somewhat [derogatory term] implying that they were feminine, or possibly homosexual) A 'Nancy' being viewed as someone effeminate & worthless. In the years after WWI, it came to mean any Sailor or Marine who wasn't worth his salt, or couldn't/shouldn't [make the cut], someone who was generally a 'shirker', and was never to be found when there was work to be done.\n\nThe word 'Poggy' also comes from the original definition of the word, and the term 'Poggy Bait' refers candy, chocolate, canned rations, ect. or any other snacks or food items that may be used to solicit [prostitutes].\n\nU.S. Army GI's stationed in the [Philippines] also used the word 'Poggy' to refer to female genitalia. (Though in Tagalog slang, the word is generally 'Pooky/Pookie', which roughly also means Cute.)\n\n'Pogue' and 'POG are two separate words/acronyms, but generally speaking the definition is similar.",

Therefore instead of saying, \"I wonder if you are lying to me, asshole?\" intent is better indicated with the pondercation point: \"I wonder if you are lying to me, asshole~`\"",
