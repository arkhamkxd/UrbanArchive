      "defid": 1584720,
      "definition": "The lands of present day Bosnia and Herzegovina was first inhabited by Illyrian and Celtic tribes until it was conquered by the Romans. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the 4th century, Bosnia was passed on to the [Byzantine Empire]. Between the 6-7th century Slav tribes started settling in what are now Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding lands. The kingdoms of Serbia and Croatia split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century. The Bosnian Kingdom (1353-1463) was ruled mostly by Serbian kings. The Bosnian Kingdom reached its peak under the Serbian king Tvrtko Kotromanic (1338-1391). Between 1463-1483 Bosnia and Herzegovina was completely conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the last Bosnian king was beheaded. During 400 years of Ottoman rule the population of Bosnia kept on changing. War with the Ottomans and the Habsburgs normally caused more migration into Bosnia; the Serbian speaking Bosnian Muslims emerged mainly because allot of people converted to Islam and the large number of settlements of the Jews. By the 19th century the Ottoman Empire became weaker and this sparked Serbian revolts and uprising in 1875; this conflict involved other Balkan states and the [involvement] of European powers, which [eventually] forced the Ottomans to give Bosnia and Herzegovina to be administrated by Austria-Hungary in 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin, and ending four centuries of Ottoman rule. From 1878-1918 Bosnia and Herzegovina was being administrated and then was annexed directly to Austria-Hungary in 1908. Tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary were high over the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina and who would get it. In June 1914 Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb, an event which triggered [the First World War]. After [the First World War] the Austro-Hungarian Empire was defeated and Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. During the [Second World] War the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in 1941 and Bosnia and Herzegovina were occupied by the Nazi [puppet state] of Croatia. After [World War Two] ended, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics of Yugoslavia in 1945, when the country was re-organized as a communist federal state under Josip Broz Tito. By 1990, political, ethnic and religious tensions were high and the country headed towards a collapse. In March 1992 the Bosnian Muslims voted for [independence] even though most Bosnian Serbs boycotted the poll. After the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced a separate Bosnian Serb republic the fighting broke out a short while later. The Bosnian Serb forces were assisted by the [Yugoslav] army and the Croatian army did the same for the Bosnian Croats. By 1993 all three forces (Serb, Croats and Muslims) were fighting each other; each side took their own policy of [ethnic cleansing]. The Bosnian War went on from 1992-1995 and costed around one hundred thousand lives. The War was going on through most of 1995 until October when all sides agreed to a truce. All three leaders Milosevic, Izetbegovic and Tudjman signed the Dayton Accords which was an agreement to end the war in former Yugoslavia. The Dayton Accords was the peace plan signed in November 1995 which gave 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs.",

The students at Boston College are smart, athletic, and attractive. BC often gets a bad rep for preppy, rich, popped collar wearing pricks. While these students exist, they are in the minority and nobody hangs out with them anyways. This reputation likely originates from jealous students at other [universities]. Students at Notre Dame, a very similar university, put too much faith in Notre Dame‚Äôs slightly better rank on most lists of the top academic schools, and now are stuck in the middle of a corn field with [nothing better to do] then hate on BC. Students at Boston University think they have a rivalry with us, but this is impossible because they don‚Äôt have any sports teams. These BU students likely hate on BC and make comparisons to our school because of rampant feelings of [inferiority] circulating throughout their ‚Äúcampus‚Äù. The students at BU pay the same tuition as the students at BC, however this does not make them our equals; the BU students are inferior to BC students in almost every way (namely [intelligence], appearance, athleticism, and [personality]). Students at BC rarely hang out with students at BU and those who do are mainly misguided freshmen who make the mistake of going to a BU frat party (which are all terrible: less booze, more baggage, and a whole lot of ugly chicks), and who will likely never return to BU again. Students at BU are not welcome at BC because they are annoying and obsess over BC, feebly trying to bash BC at every [opportunity]. The BC ‚Äì BU [relationship] is confined to three times a year when we play them in hockey. Usually at some point during BC home hockey games [versus] BU, the BC fans get fed up with the BU fans and start chanting ‚Äúsafety school‚Äù. This is mean but it is also true. The majority of the Massachusetts natives at BC used BU as their safety school. Hopefully, eventually, the BU students will catch on and stop bothering us. Both of these schools hate on BC on a regular basis, however, BC rarely bothers to defend itself. We are more mature than that, and we are too busy partying, and attending sporting events against teams we play on more than a semi-regular basis (like Duke, Virginia, Wake Forest, and [Florida State]).",

A botnet's originator can control the group remotely, usually through a means such as IRC, and usually for nefarious purposes. Individual programs manifest as IRC \"bots\". Often the command and control takes place via an IRC server or a specific channel on a public IRC network. A bot typically runs hidden, and complies with the RFC 1459 (IRC) standard. Generally, the perpetrator of the botnet has [compromised] a series of systems using various tools (exploits, buffer overflows, as well as others; see also RPC). Newer bots can [automatically] scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet owner community",

Both could be done without in the end because of their serious bias on [everything] that ever happens.\r\n\r\nThere are few types of people who fall into this group:\r\n1.Activists-the troublemakers who are\r\nviolent and crazy but try to cover up by pretending that their motives are moral.\r\n\r\n2:Stoners-people who have taken a lot of time to think through where they stand politically, and realize that violence is an ineffective way to reach their goal, even if the establishment is refusing to listen to them. These people think Bush is a terrible president, and give logical reasons.\r\n\r\n3:Metalheads-people who have taken a lot of time to think through where they stand politically, but are too carefree to do anything more than write music about it. Also, they are pessimistic and feel they will never change anything. This group also has logical reasons for hating Bush, such as the fact that the only Iraqis killed by Sadam were rebels who were trying to [assassinate] HIM.\r\n\r\n4.Nobodies-people who really have none of their own views, but will make themselves think they believe in anything that is popular. Once they have a cause in mind, they will gather any evidence, without even thinking through it enough to realize it doesnt make any real sense. This group is very anti-Bush, but cannot give logical reasons why he is a bad president, such as the fact that he has a Texas accent(No shit. How is that a problem?)\r\n\r\nBleeding-heart liberal, or [bleeding ass liberal] is usually used by right-wing [conservatives] to refer to any and all democrats or liberals.\r\nMiddle-roaders like me use it for any person who thinks only about the benifit of individuals rather than society as a whole.

Examples below.\r\n\r\n*[Often] the [ultimate diss] is to combine 4 B's ending in Bitch and beginning with Brolic. Often used as a harsh punch-line in turning down a girl.\r\n\r\nBrolic is often used to describe atheltic women who are \"unnaturaly\" muscular and is the only word i've heard to describe athetlic women in the informal context.\r\n\r\nA more respective [alternative] might be \"brickhouse\" which means the woman is in shape but certainly doesn't look like a man. (ie- Serena Williams) Brickhouse can be a very well recieved complement. \r\n\r\nBrolic on the other hand (if you are a female) means your face resembles a box and you should lighten up on the workouts and eat some platanos and gain some booty and titty fat or something for dudes to grab on to.\r\n\r\nDudes generally don't like \"Brolic\" chicks, we like some gellatin to wiggle around and smack. Brolic means you are 99% muscle and your ass is [hard as a rock]. \r\n\r\nWhole purpose of men liking females is because they are soft and squishy.

The sheer scale of the Bernie pandemic dwarves that of the current corona virus pandemic, as bernies reportedly exist on other planets, realities and solar systems.\n\nNot all men called Bernie are Bernies, and any man, regardless of name, can be a Bernie. The most tragic aspect of the nature of the Bernie is that he can never become self aware as it would be too harmful to his sense of self, and his personal reality. If a Bernie were to become self aware (there are no reports of this happening ever across both time and space) it is theorised that he would [spontaneously] combust from the sheer shock of realising how much he sucks.",
