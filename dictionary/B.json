      "defid": 1584720,
      "definition": "The lands of present day Bosnia and Herzegovina was first inhabited by Illyrian and Celtic tribes until it was conquered by the Romans. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the 4th century, Bosnia was passed on to the [Byzantine Empire]. Between the 6-7th century Slav tribes started settling in what are now Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding lands. The kingdoms of Serbia and Croatia split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century. The Bosnian Kingdom (1353-1463) was ruled mostly by Serbian kings. The Bosnian Kingdom reached its peak under the Serbian king Tvrtko Kotromanic (1338-1391). Between 1463-1483 Bosnia and Herzegovina was completely conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the last Bosnian king was beheaded. During 400 years of Ottoman rule the population of Bosnia kept on changing. War with the Ottomans and the Habsburgs normally caused more migration into Bosnia; the Serbian speaking Bosnian Muslims emerged mainly because allot of people converted to Islam and the large number of settlements of the Jews. By the 19th century the Ottoman Empire became weaker and this sparked Serbian revolts and uprising in 1875; this conflict involved other Balkan states and the [involvement] of European powers, which [eventually] forced the Ottomans to give Bosnia and Herzegovina to be administrated by Austria-Hungary in 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin, and ending four centuries of Ottoman rule. From 1878-1918 Bosnia and Herzegovina was being administrated and then was annexed directly to Austria-Hungary in 1908. Tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary were high over the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina and who would get it. In June 1914 Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb, an event which triggered [the First World War]. After [the First World War] the Austro-Hungarian Empire was defeated and Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. During the [Second World] War the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in 1941 and Bosnia and Herzegovina were occupied by the Nazi [puppet state] of Croatia. After [World War Two] ended, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics of Yugoslavia in 1945, when the country was re-organized as a communist federal state under Josip Broz Tito. By 1990, political, ethnic and religious tensions were high and the country headed towards a collapse. In March 1992 the Bosnian Muslims voted for [independence] even though most Bosnian Serbs boycotted the poll. After the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced a separate Bosnian Serb republic the fighting broke out a short while later. The Bosnian Serb forces were assisted by the [Yugoslav] army and the Croatian army did the same for the Bosnian Croats. By 1993 all three forces (Serb, Croats and Muslims) were fighting each other; each side took their own policy of [ethnic cleansing]. The Bosnian War went on from 1992-1995 and costed around one hundred thousand lives. The War was going on through most of 1995 until October when all sides agreed to a truce. All three leaders Milosevic, Izetbegovic and Tudjman signed the Dayton Accords which was an agreement to end the war in former Yugoslavia. The Dayton Accords was the peace plan signed in November 1995 which gave 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs.",

Bosnia and Herzegovina borders with Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a very [mountainous] country with lots of rivers and has a small coast on the Adriatic sea (around 20km).

Students at BC rarely hang out with students at BU and those who do are mainly misguided freshmen who make the mistake of going to a BU frat party (which are all terrible: less booze, more baggage, and a whole lot of ugly chicks), and who will likely never return to BU again. Students at BU are not welcome at BC because they are annoying and obsess over BC, feebly trying to bash BC at every [opportunity]. The BC ‚Äì BU [relationship] is confined to three times a year when we play them in hockey. Usually at some point during BC home hockey games [versus] BU, the BC fans get fed up with the BU fans and start chanting ‚Äúsafety school‚Äù. This is mean but it is also true. The majority of the Massachusetts natives at BC used BU as their safety school. Hopefully, eventually, the BU students will catch on and stop bothering us. Both of these schools hate on BC on a regular basis, however, BC rarely bothers to defend itself.

Generally, the perpetrator of the botnet has [compromised] a series of systems using various tools (exploits, buffer overflows, as well as others; see also RPC). Newer bots can [automatically] scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet owner community",
      "example": "i'll [send] my botnet on your [server] and [mess u] up",

These people think Bush is a terrible president, and give logical reasons.\r\n\r\n3:Metalheads-people who have taken a lot of time to think through where they stand politically, but are too carefree to do anything more than write music about it. Also, they are pessimistic and feel they will never change anything. This group also has logical reasons for hating Bush, such as the fact that the only Iraqis killed by Sadam were rebels who were trying to [assassinate] HIM.\r\n\r\n4.Nobodies-people who really have none of their own views, but will make themselves think they believe in anything that is popular. Once they have a cause in mind, they will gather any evidence, without even thinking through it enough to realize it doesnt make any real sense. This group is very anti-Bush, but cannot give logical reasons why he is a bad president, such as the fact that he has a Texas accent(No shit.

Examples below.\r\n\r\n*[Often] the [ultimate diss] is to combine 4 B's ending in Bitch and beginning with Brolic. Often used as a harsh punch-line in turning down a girl.\r\n\r\nBrolic is often used to describe atheltic women who are \"unnaturaly\" muscular and is the only word i've heard to describe athetlic women in the informal context.\r\n\r\nA more respective [alternative] might be \"brickhouse\" which means the woman is in shape but certainly doesn't look like a man. (ie- Serena Williams) Brickhouse can be a very well recieved complement. \r\n\r\nBrolic on the other hand (if you are a female) means your face resembles a box and you should lighten up on the workouts and eat some platanos and gain some booty and titty fat or something for dudes to grab on to.\r\n\r\nDudes generally don't like \"Brolic\" chicks, we like some gellatin to wiggle around and smack. Brolic means you are 99% muscle and your ass is [hard as a rock]. \r\n\r\nWhole purpose of men liking females is because they are soft and squishy.

Also, when burning, it is best not to actually start the burn, that is, a burn is more painful if the victim says something normal and the burner makes a burning comment, or addition to what the victim said, thus burning the victim. So never say the beginning to what makes a burn; you'll just sound stupid. So good luck, be quick, don't say \"burn\" if you're burning someone, and don't say the starting words to a burn.

However, it was delayed a few hours due to glitches of the intro2 and ended up being released on January 10, 2021. The intro was made by Elias A. \"coal bones\", RickToons, and Amor Boretto, and the song played in the TPOT intro is called \"Gibberish!!\".\n\nIf each episode continues the trend of having 2 characters eliminated each, there will be at least 20 episodes.",

      "defid": 3192685,
      "definition": "1) Noun: A man who was once called \"The King of R&B\" and \"The King of Stage\". He was a street kid started singing with neighbors Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins in the ghettos of Roxbury, [Massachusetts] for change after school for the movies in 1978. Fellow Roxbury singers Ralph Tresvant and Ronnie DeVove joined with him to form the group \"New Edition\" by 1981 and got a record deal by 1982. Split from the group in 1986 after stage antics and went on to achieve mega-stardom by 1988 with his hits \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Every Little Step\", \"Rock Wit'cha\" and \"Roni\". By 1989, was the most popular black male artist/[entertainer] in the [United States] whose concerts could get so wild he was arrested for it more than once. At that point he could be considered a male equivalent of a diva. He also did cameos in some of the songs of the solo New Edition members in 1990 and 1991, including a brief reunion with New Edition in Bell Biv DeVoe's 1991 song \"Word To The Mutha\". In 1992, he hooked up [Whitney Houston], a nationally popular diva and fellow street girl with equally phonemoninal stage presence. Similar to Bobby, she was a street girl from Newark, New Jersey and had been into the sex and drugs underground scene in [the music industry] since the 80's. There were even semi-credible tabloid rumors she was bisexual or lesbian. Bobby married her in 1992 and they remained an odd [yet] accepted couple until the mid-90's when their careers begin to fade amidst a mixture of change in national music interests, self-destructive drug habits and yearly misdemanors. By the late-90's he was considered washed-up and had been cruely transformed by the media into a circus spectacle, not unlike [Britney Spears] today. Except Bobby had talent. He relesed a new CD in 1997 which didn't do very well commercially and didn't realease another song until 2002 with Ja Rule which sparked rumors of a return that fell flat. Suffered a tragic stroke that same year which left his mouth permanently turned the side when he talks. Instead of making a comeback he started a [reality show] called \"Being Bobby Brown\" which largely showcased his and Whitney's drug-induced antics and let the world see Whitney's ugly side. In 2006 he temporarily reunited with New Edition on tour but was dropped after more stage antics. In 2007 he filed for divorce which was finalized in 2008 and released a controversial tell-all book. In 2008-9 he plans to permanently rejoin New Edition and tour with them for their 25th Anniversery of national fame. Now that he's divorced from his smoking buddy Whitney maybe he can get his act together, stay off of drugs permanently, turn his life around and re-ignite his career. Fortunately most of his talent has been left intact if not his public reputation. [Unfortunately] many [Whitney Houston] fans will irrationally forever hate him because they blame him for Whitney's downfall that she herself caused just like he caused his own downfall.",
      "example": "Prima: \"Man, that Bobby Brown is such a [fucking loser]. No wonder Whitney left him.\"\r\n\r\nSecunda: \"What? Whitney married him for a reason: he was hot and they were into the same stuff. She was probably into coke since her modeling career before her singing career. Her and Bobby both liked the wild party life when not on stage.\"\r\n\r\nPrima: \"Maybe, but he's still a washed-up and cracked-out loser.\"\r\n\r\nSecunda: \"What are you talking about? Bobby was a national sensation in his day just like Whitney. They called him 'The King of R&B' [for crying out loud]. He was the most popular black artist around. Now that he's getting back on his feet, if he seriously gets himself together and comes back he will blow Usher and Chris Brown [out of the water] with little effort.\"",

Most of the time it‚Äôs bearable though, although there‚Äôs a fair share of wannabe roadmen, chavs and neeks. Most of the girls there smoke weed or any other substance they can get there hands on. The year 7s will either be wannabe roadmen or normal 11 year olds waffling on about Fortnite. Most of the younger years (Year 7-9) will spend their time putting lip gloss on their lips until you get sunburn from the [reflection]. Tthe selection of potential [girlfriends]/[boyfriends] isn't too bad there either. When you don‚Äôt want to put a bullet through your skull, it‚Äôs quite fun. There‚Äôs also bare seagulls that will nick your rubbish and food the second they get. Oh and mind in the corridors when you hear loud footsteps as it‚Äôs probably some year 8 [wannabe roadman] getting rude to a year 11. On the astros you'll either get the girls sitting in the corners or dotted around the edge of the fence, and the boys [kicking around] a football (be careful not to let your ball trickle into any surrounding areas or it WILL be booted). In conclusion, it has its ups, it has its downs, i‚Äôd give it a solid 6/10 because of the students I find don‚Äôt worry there are some good ones (same for teachers) but there are also some dogshit ones, so watch out for them.",

Also bring several 20 [dollar bills] in case you need to bribe Los Federales. Be sure to tip your cab driver generously on your way in and out. The Boys Town in Nuevo Laredo is the most renowned of all of them. The primary attraction is the [donkey show]. Every night the [donkey show] bar has a central area where gringos and some Mexicanos surround. The spectators begin throwing crumbled up one [dollar bills] into the \"area\". If enough money gets in there, then a waiter brings out the \"donkey\". Usually the money throwing continues. As the cash flow increases the senorita comes out and begins performing sex acts on the donkey. She will first arouse the donkey and then put an extra large condom on it. Usually she will sodomize the donkey with oral first, and if enough money comes in then she will finish the donkey off with vaginal. If the donkey ejaculates, she will remove the condom and chunk it into the crowd and one poor soul will be screwed.",

The balls, which are iron, help offset magnetic shifts so [the compass] inside the binnacle remains pointed toward magnetic north. The two balls are traditionally mounted on brass arms, which were called 'monkeys' by sailors in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe phrase 'cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey' didn't rear its head into common usage until the 20th century. Original uses referred to 'freezing the tail of a brass monkey,' or 'melting the nose off a brass monkey,' and can be found in 19th century sailing texts like Herman Melville's \"Omoo\" ('...it was 'ot enough to melt the nose h'off a brass monkey....').\n\nAgain, while the exact meaning is unkown, the term has beeen definitively rejected by the Department of the Navy, the Oxford [English Dictionary] and other noted etymologists as describing a pyramid of cannonballs on a brass tray. Not only were they never used on board ship during the age of sail as they would have rolled [everywhere] with the rocking of the ship, but the balls and tray would expand and contract at nearly the same rate due to cold and heat, and therefore the stack would never have fallen apart due [temperature] change.",

According to eastern practitioners, male orgasm with ejaculation is one fleeting moment of intense and even excruciating pleasure. On the other hand, the ability to orgasm without ejaculation is said to be a continual rolling expansion of the orgasm, with emensley heightened ecstasy.\n\n[Unfortunately], to learn this art, a man would need to spend years at an eastern ashram, performing spiritual and physical exercises designed to develop the skill. The reason this art is so rare in western cultures is that most modern men see something patently wrong with some [old], foul-smelling, skinny, toothless, bearded Swami freak wearing nothing but a turban and a loin cloth touching their perineum point for demonstration purposes.\n\nWarning: any user of the term should be aware that this phrase may be perceived in some circles to be crude or vulgar.

Though they are often considered slower than the rest of the pack, bros have an innate sense of [where the party at]. It is unclear whether hipsters depart brosified districts because they are no longer cool, or are pushed out by the overt demonstrations of affection and popular culture preferred by the bros, but hipster populations decline in direct correlation to brosification. There is no known method to reverse the effects of brosification.

To them, Archie Bunker is a hero figure.\n\nBufords enjoy chewing tobacco, hunting deer, not going to college, mullets, country music, the worst songs on the [classic rock] station, doing the laziest manual labor possible (think of a fat guy who can barely walk sitting on a [John Deere] machine all day), pretending they're tough, and ganging up on people who are different from them. In the South, a common form of this behavior was lynching. In modern times, it's often just three or more guys attacking one person in a back alley somewhere.\n\nBufords often get into law enforcement positions because they are angry, ignorant bullies by nature.\n\nIt is estimated 80% of [Republicans] are bufords.
