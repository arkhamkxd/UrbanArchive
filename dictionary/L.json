The Good- Being a female who, by birth, is attracted to other females.

Most times, she will not push females who just haven't \"[come out of the closet]\" yet, either, as she respects their feelings and space.\r\n\r\n2.The Bad - This classification of lesbian generally does give proper respect the striaght female, or a female having trouble \"[coming out of the closet]\".  She (the lesbian) would push untill a female, not of lesbian stature, would be \"willing\" to date, have [sexual intercourse], or perform some other form of lesbian action with her, if possible.  This type of lesbian is also likely to dispise all males.\r\n\r\n3. The Ugly - This is the LEAST respectible kind of Lesbian, in terms of \"method\" of becoming a lesbian. Though not naturally born a lesbian, is introduced to \"girl-on-girl\" material at a young age,  only to become courious and try such sexual acts with friends.  Sexually curiosity is NOT a crime, but it is dispicable that young females become lesbian because of socities display of females. If not for such material, this type of lesbian would be less likely to exist, as once they engage in lesbian activities, it is mainly for the pleasure of sex.  This classification of lesbian can also be discribed as a lesbian under 'The Good' or 'The Bad' catagorey, with out the addition of being a female by nature.",
      "example": "Lesbian - \"Jane enjoys talking and being with other females more than males.  She has little to no intrest in males sexually or emotionally, and thats why she considers herself a lesbian.\"\r\n\r\nThe Good - \"Sherry is a lesbian, but will not hit on or preasure her straight friends to engage in lesbian activities with her.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bad - \"Terry constally tries to suduce females, [even if] they are straight and are annoyed by her.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ugly - \"Sally, when she was only 13, had [engaged in] sexually activities with other females, only because she and her friend has seen something similar on TV and thought it would be 'fun'.  Since then, she has had less and less intrest in boys, and gradually became a lesbian through sex.\"\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n-The author is a [straight male] and these are his OPINIONS based\r\non multiple FACTS. He accepts gays/lesbians as everyone should.  \r\n-Not all lesbians would fit under each catagorey EXACTALLY but [generally].",
