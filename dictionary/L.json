The game is set during the aftermath of an [apocalyptic] pandemic outbreak in Pennsylvania.

PILLS HERE!\n\nBill - a former Green Beret (which explains the hat) and 'Nam vet. The leader of the group and has infinite knowledge of combat.\n\nFrancis - a tattoo covered biker who tends to be the one to save your ass whenever it's on the line for some reason.\n\nZoey - a [college student] and horror film enthusiast. She is the only female of the group which leads to weird moments.\n\nEach campaign, the survivors begin with a M1911 Pistol, which has an unlimited amount of ammo; later on in the campaign, the player can require another pistol, which equals what? Dual pistols beeotch. The pistol is the only weapon you can use when you are [incapacitated]. Yeah, that really helps. Also when starting out, there will be a table with ammo, med kits, pipe bombs, [molotov cocktails] and the choice between a pump-action shotgun or an Uzi. Later on you can get more advanced weapons like an [automatic shotgun], a hunting rifle, and an assault rifle.\n\nThese campaigns have names, No duh. In each campaign, the survivors have to get to a safe house or room, whatever. The goal is to get to an extraction point, where you will receive rescue albeit from an airplane, a boat, a helicopter, etc. Before being rescued, the A.I. Director, who controls when infected attack or not, will send a shitload of infected and special infected to [fuck you up]. This usually is bearable, as long as the team dumbass doesn't wander off.\n\nDeath Toll - a small town and countryside setting, culminating at a dock house.\n\nNo Mercy - an urban setting and [hospital setting], culminating at a hospital skyscraper helipad.\n\nDead Air - an airport setting, culminating at the landing runway of the airport.\n\nBlood Harvest - a farm setting, culminating at a farm house. This is the hardest campaign in the game, hands down.\n\nPeople tend to mistake the enemies for [zombies]. They aren't zombies, they're infected, but hey, whatever floats you're boat.\n\nInfected - a regular \"zombie\" or infected, whatever.\n\nHorde - a huge ass group of infected, which are attracted to loud noises and bright lights. Which means DON'T shoot [the fucking] cars with alarms and DO throw the pipe bomb.\n\nSpecial Infected:\n\nBoomer - special infected who is fat and vomits all over you, which attracts a horde. Whenever you kill him, his fatass explodes, [getting blood] all over you.\n\nSmoker - special infected who can be heard miles away because of his horrendous cough. His tongue is like a thousand feet long and tries to choke yo bitch ass with it. When killing this enemy, he just vanishes into smoke.\n\nHunter - special infected with a liking to blue hoodies. The hunter has a distinct shriek, and can jump high into the air and pounce your ass.\n\nWitch - special infected who is a [crazy ass bitch]. You can tell whenever you are near her, because she is crying. DO NOT be so stupid to believe that she is human. If she is disturbed, she can incapacitate you with one hit. So don't fuck with her, unless you plan on killing her with one shot. What's more fucked up is that in L4D2, she will be able to walk.\n\nTank - special infected who appears to have taken way too much fucking steroids. He's about over 10 feet tall and always seems to be able to pull concrete out of the ground and throw it at you, even though you could be fighting him on grass, but he'll magically be able to pull concrete out of the ground. He can also punch your ass halfway across the map. You can't avoid him, so get an automatic weapon out and unload on his ass.",

Once wrote a song about a girl, and was quoted to say this about it: \"She took me back to her apartment, and started playing me all these songs. And all I wanted to do was kiss her. But it didn't happen, and it was never going to happen, so I wrote a really mean song about her. Cause that's ust the kind of guy I am. I'm a passive, aggressive, [motherfucker].\"\r\n\r\n3. Hated J. Mascis for a long period of time for kicking him out of [Dinosaur Jr]. The song \"Freed Pig\" is about J. In an interview done by pitchforkmedia in 2002, they asked Lou about a story that had been going around about how Kim Deal of The Breeders (and earlier of The Pixies) had played freed pig for J, and he had been so stoned he didn't know the song was about him, so J said he thought it was a great song. Lou's response was, \"I would ask her, but it just sounds too good to be true.\"\r\n\r\n4. A bassist, guitarist, and singer.",

      "defid": 2356379,
      "definition": "Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance: The [Lighthouse] of Alexandria. For sailors, it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor. For architects, it meant even more: it was the tallest building on Earth. And for scientists, it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km (35 miles) off-shore. \r\n\r\nLocation\r\nOn the ancient island of Pharos, now a promontory within the city of Alexandria in Egypt. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nShortly after the death of [Alexander the Great], his commander Ptolemy Soter assumed power in Egypt. He had witnessed the founding of Alexandria, and established his capital there. Off of the city's coast lies a small island: Pharos. Its name, legend says, is a variation of Pharaoh's Island, but it is more likely that the name is Greek in origin. The island was connected to the mainland by means of a dike - the Heptastadion - which gave the city a double harbor. And because of dangerous sailing conditions and flat coastline in the region, the [construction] of a [lighthouse] was necessary. \r\n\r\nThe project was conceived and initiated by Ptolemy Soter around 290 BC, but was completed after his death, during the reign of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus. Sostratus, a [contemporary] of Euclid, was the architect, but detailed calculations for the structure and its accessories were carried out at the Alexandria Library/Mouseion. The monument was dedicated to the Savior Gods: Ptolemy Soter (lit. savior) and his wife Berenice. For centuries, the [Lighthouse] of Alexandria (occasionally referred to as the Pharos [Lighthouse]) was used to mark the harbor, using fire at night and reflecting sun rays during the day. It was even shown on Roman coins, just as famous monuments are depicted on currency today. \r\n\r\nWhen the Arabs conquered Egypt, they admired Alexandria and its wealth. The Lighthouse continues to be mentioned in their writings and travelers accounts. But the new rulers moved their capital to Cairo since they had no ties to the Mediterranean. When the mirror was brought down mistakenly, they did not restore it back into place. In AD 956, an earthquake shook Alexandria, and caused little damage to the Lighthouse. It was later in 1303 and in 1323 that two stronger earthquakes left a [significant] [impression] on the structure. When the famous Arab traveler Ibn Battuta visited Alexandria in 1349, he could not enter the ruinous monument or even climb to its doorway. \r\n\r\n[The final chapter] in the history of the Lighthouse came in AD 1480 when the Egyptian Mamelouk Sultan, Qaitbay, decided to fortify Alexandria's defense. He built a medieval fort on the same spot where the Lighthouse once stood, using the fallen stone and marble. \r\n\r\n[Description]\r\nOf the six vanished Wonders, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was the last to disappear. Therefore we have adequately accurate knowledge of its location and appearance. Ancient accounts such as those by Strabo and Pliny the Elder give us a brief [description] of the \"tower\" and the magnificent [white marble] cover. They tell us how the mysterious mirror could reflect the light tens of kilometers away. Legend says the mirror was also used to detect and burn enemy ships before they could reach the shore. \r\n\r\nIn 1166, an Arab traveler, Abou-Haggag Al-Andaloussi visited the Lighthouse. He documented a wealth of [information] and gave an accurate [description] of the structure which helped modern archeologists reconstruct the monument. It was composed of three stages: The lowest square, 55.9 m (183.4 ft) high with a cylindrical core; the middle octagonal with a side length of 18.30 m (60.0 ft) and a height of 27.45 m (90.1 ft); and the third circular 7.30 m (24.0 ft) high. The total height of the building including the foundation base was about 117 m (384 ft), equivalent to a 40-story modern building. The internal core was used as a shaft to lift the fuel needed for the fire. At the top stage, the mirror reflected sunlight during the day while fire was used during the night. In ancient times, a statue of Poseidon adorned the summit of the building. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Lighthouse of Alexandria did not survive to the present day, it left its influence in various respects. From an architectural standpoint, the monument has been used as a model for many prototypes along the Mediterranean, as far away as Spain. And from a linguistic standpoint, it gave its name -- Pharos -- to all the lighthouses in the world... Just look up the dictionary for the French, Italian, or Spanish word for lighthouse.",

Female Lions are commonly described as more dangerous as they are the hunters of their prides. They bring food which they mostly do at night. The male Lions are more commonly described as the Alpha of the pride but, they only respect and follow female Lions. This also describes the name of Lea. She is [the strongest], alpha, ones bringing the food to the family. They are also known for their endurance, power and great will.

Moving to the bathroom for [shower sex] is also acceptable.\n\nOne sex can also be substituted with oral received once by each partner; so a laudle could include 6 positions and 1 exchange of oral each (2 orals total).\r\nNote: all positions must differ from each other.

      "definition": "Less Jake is a (curently) five-piece melodic punk band out of Gainesville, Florida. Despite what most people think, they are not ska. They started off as a power-pop-punk trio with metal and punk [influences], then the drummer, Vinnie started thinking, \"Hey, some horns would be cool,\" after [listening] to [The Specials]. In their decade of writing [incredible] songs, they have undoubtably written some ska, but the majority is punk, albeit with horns.\r\n\r\nThe band has put out so many records [it's not even funny], and is touring constantly, and they have been doing this for many years. They [represent] the punk mindstate, as they always do shit for their fans. Then after the release of Anthem, so many of their fans turned around and started calling them sellouts, just for signing to a major label (Warner Brothers/Sire). They said this, when in fact, the only thing that changed is now more people have access to their [incredible] music and terribly deep lyrics. I must admit, some trendhoppers peeking their way into Less Than Jake can get annoying, having to see them call \"Look What Happened\" \"I Swear It's [the Last Time]\", and seeing them just in general tarnish the loyalty Less Than Jake's fan body, it's bad, and it can hurt. The fact that they are on a big label doesn't make them sellouts. Anthem is my least favorite LTJ record, I admit, but overall quality is still uncompromised (She's Gonna Break Soon is a pretty shitty song though).\r\n\r\nMemberwise, Less Than Jake is currently Chris on guitar and vox, Roger on bass and vox, Vinnie on drums and he writes the lyrics, Buddy on trombone, and JR on tenor sax. Roger has another band called Rehasher, in which he plays guitar. Roger is [pretty good] at guitar, and he mostly writes the lyrics for them, and has proved to be as adept as Vinnie with lyrics. Vinnie writes the best lyrics [ever], if I may express my opinion. What he wrties is so deep, and most anyone who cares to look can extract multiple levels of meaning from his lyrics. Buddy is one of the best trombonists not involved in orchestral or jazz music, if not the best. JR has some solo music where he plays guitar and sings. Previous members include Chris, their first bassist; their second bassist Shaun, who was a roadie after he was replaced by Roger; Jessica, who played alto sax, who now teaches highschool in Gainesville; Derron on bari sax, who started a kickass band called Gunmoll, now broken up; and finally Pete on trombone, who now is a firefighter, and is rumored to be a firefighter in Antarctica (I don't get it either).",
