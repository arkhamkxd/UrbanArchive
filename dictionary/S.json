      "definition": "Scousers are an [interesting] result of the [industrial revolution] and Liverpool is a true immigrant city equalled only with London, New York and Buenos Aires. Most Scousers are of Irish and Welsh descent though the city has long standing Chinese, West African and Scandinavian communities with the term 'Scouser' coming from the dish 'Lobscouse' which is a bastardization of the Norwegian word 'labskaus' which is a Norwegian lamb/mutton stew.\r\n\r\nI have read a lot of the enteries on here and knowing the city and a lot of the people I feel I can make a decent unbiased job of writing a fair review about Liverpool.\r\n\r\nScousers are famous for the [sense of humour], though they can laugh at others and do so regulary, they cannot laugh at themselves, any joke about Liverpool is taken as a great insult, Scousers tend to have a [victimized]/martyrdom complex but despite this they are capable of great acts of charity and benevolence. Scousers more often than not employ a disarming but [superficial] friendliness to strangers - it is only when you get to know a Scouser that they start to grate.\r\n\r\nScousers have a 'big man' complex, most Scousers are not physically big nor physically hard though they are able to intimdate people through shouting at them with a guttural accent that has changed a lot in the past 30 years so they can sound more tough. Scousers can be violent and aggresive but the vast majority cannot fight to save their life - another paradox of [this is that] Liverpool is a famous amateur boxing city and has produced many fighters in the lighter weight divsions though never a really good big man and they never will due to the typical Scousers puny physique.\r\n\r\nThe 'Big Man' complex is more apparent in the workplace, Scousers as a rule loath to work but when forced to put in a days graft, Scousers all want to be the boss - 99.9% of them aren't capable of bossing a lemming over the cliff but their attitude to earning a honest living means they aren't receptive to working 8 hours a day under the orders of someone else - strikes and [industrial action] is still common in Liverpool even in these fraught times - Scousers therefore like to go into small business such as [window cleaning] and market stall trading and the shadier ones go into petty crime such as burgulary, drug dealing etc.\r\n\r\nLiverpool is a great city in many ways that has inspired great artists,\r\nwriters, poets and musicians and is [one of the most] aestheically beautiful architectural cities in the world - however Scousers have a [love hate relationship] with Manchester - a horrid shit tip 30 miles away - It is lost on the majority of Scousers that the Mancunian is the most closest thing to a Scouser you can get in look, attitude and lifestyle. Scousers are nothing like Geordies or Glaswegians like they purport to be, but the Scouser and the Mancunian is an near identical animal.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you will never ever hear a Scouser saying is 'Oh! I never/didn't know that?' Scousers know [everything] about anything. A Scouser will never admit to not knowing about any subject on planet earth and is quite capable of telling a [brain surgeon] how to do thier job despite the fact the Scouser in question might be a milkman or a doley or something equally as tragic.\r\n\r\nScousers have a highly developed and protective sense of self, they are proud to be born in the city and any 'Texan' 'Plazzy' or 'Wool' who claims to be [one of them] is going to get the heave ho before long, they are not tolerant of non Scousers claiming to be Scousers. \r\n\r\nEven the good people of Birkenhead, Kirkby, Huyton and Skem are seen as 'plazzies' even though the rest of the planet see them as Scousers. It is a complex state of affairs. (If you are from Skem that is!)\r\n\r\nThe true Scouse accent is Celtic in origin, it is a mixture of Welsh, Irish and Lancastrian dialects, the lilting sounds of John Lennon have now been replaced by the rasping, guttural sound\r\nof the Scouser of today - apparentley \r\nTVs Eastenders is the biggest influence in the change of the accent over the past 30 years!\r\n\r\nLiverpool has a higher ratio of beautiful women than in other parts of the UK down to the high racial mixing \r\nof the populace - its is not uncommon for your bog standard Scouser to have a \r\nSomalian/Paraguayan/Egypt ian/Burmese etc grandparent or great grandparent which leads to attractive women - though their attractivness is negated by their big mouths and bad attitudes - mind you\r\nthey have been dealing with their male [counterparts] since birth so I can [understand] it but I wouldn't want any part of it!\r\n\r\nI could do a piece about the football but a) It has been covered ad nauseum and b) I would have to mention Heysel and the pre 1989 'Munich 58' song.",

Many debate over the region's borders but primarily consists of Santa Barbara and areas of California farther southwards. However, recently many have used the term to describe the posh regions around the Los Angeles and [Orange County] regions, classifying many of it's inhabitants as \"socalers\". \"socalers\" are generally regarded as those seen on the frightenly popular shows, such as \"The OC\" and more recently \"Laguna Beach: the Real OC\". To that end, the term has recieved a connotation that all perons living in southern California are rich, white, asshole, cokeheads.  While this might describe a vast majority of costal community dwellers, it tends to incorporate others who just like the area and say \"fuckoff\" to those rich asshole fuckers.  San Diego, being the farthest south does not have as many of the costal pricks as say, Laguna Beach, or areas of LA that tend to have a lot of coke and rich pricks. ANd just as a reference, [northern california] has the best weed and if you disagree you've never been there. Also Norcal is not any better than Socal it just has fewer people and more trees.  And just as a side note, all wholive in california need to put this retarded debate to rest. It is an absolutely meaningless rivalry.

With energy levels peaking, horns and woofers blasting, and fans in a frenzy, STITCH RIVET becomes unstoppable.\r\n\r\nFormed in March of 2006, the group consists of five members; Gene Booth, Chad (Wick) Hurlburt, Nathan Lewis, Tyler Halsey and Kevin Allen.

Several of their songs on radio stations throughout Eastern Kentucky. Their original music has them performing at the best venues in Lexington such as A1A, The [Cadillac Ranch] and The Kentucky Theater.\r\n\r\nTwo of the many potential hits on the album,[FRANKENSTEIN] and DAY BY DAY have attracted the attention of SHOWHOUSE PRODUCTIONS LLC resulting the filming of two music videos. STITCH RIVET has also performed alongside national acts such as Drowning Pool, Bobaflex, Seven Mary Three and Nappy Roots.\r\n\r\nThe group was also included high on the roster of bands performing at the first annual Gateway Music Festival in September of 2007 and at the 2007 Poage Landing Days Festival in Ashland, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWith blues, metal, and jazz as a basis for their influence, they compose their songs with simple [complexity] to give a warm depth to the creation.

The result was brutal fighting between British colonizers and guerilla tribes of Squilliams, armed with whatever they could find. At first, the less-equipped Squilliams struggled with their oppressors, who wielded advanced firearms and horses. However, Squilliams were able to make use of their habitat, which the British colonizers were not familiar with. The British government was no match for these ravenous beasts and were forced to withdraw from the sporadic fighting.

Also, the animation is trash, and the HD widescreen remasters make it look even worse.

Ska is the precursor to reggae music, which in America seems to be a more popular genre, and has never been widely accepted as a true style of music (meaning you won't find it as a tag on iTunes as of today, [October 13th], '09). Many people are haters of ska music, and some of my close friends are big fans. I don't see what the big deal is about popularity and social standards. I like ska because it's full of hype and positive energy, and I love to dance to it. I get dirty looks from people when I play ska in the car or on my stereo, especially when they hear the horn section (tends to induce a WHAT-THE-FUCK-ARE-YOU-LISTENING-TO?!\" response) And it's funny, if I take the time to play the band \"Cake\" before a ska song, people are suddenly reminded that having a horn section in a band isn't a reason to tell the DJ to go fuck himself/herself. Let's be honest. I'm a white middle class [suburban kid]. I'm not a \"gangsta\", and therefore, I'm not going to be [superficial] and listen to rap music because [everyone else does] and because it makes me feel like I'm the shit. If I like a rap song, I'll listen to it because I like the tone, the rhythm, the rhyme: The same reason why I like Ska. I'm going to be cheesy now: Ska has heart and soul. I love it because it makes me happy and makes me feel young. As I grow older, I won't stop listening to Ska, because it's not a dead genre, and it will never die. I'll shut up now. Skank On!",

This might [include] instances of spending hours at the [grocery store] while agonizing over the metaphysical benefits of chunky [peanut butter] or two-ply toilet paper.\n\n*Are you overly sensitive to caffeine substances like coffee, Redbull or chocolate-dipped pretzels? Is your knee still bouncing?\n\n*Do you make over $75,000 a year yet still find yourself wearing Vans/New Balance shoes and graphic t-shirts at work and during your free-time?\n\n*Do you shun traditional social gatherings that require that you interact with non-intellectual scum (read: non-academics that have 9-5's and/or lowly humanity degrees) and that requires that you shave/brush your teeth/switch out one Stanford sweatshirt for another?\n\n*Do you have multiple food/pet/medication allergies that require you to keep an EpiPen in the glovebox of your leased Accord?",

[Unfortunately], this is a [chronic condition] that often goes untreated in most; often thriving in hi-tech companies and Toast Master gatherings.\n\nExample:\r\nNon-SVS friend: This party is SO awkward! Everyone is totally wasted...but they're all talking about stem cell imaging or their boring day-trips to Napa. I haven't looked anyone in the eye for like, two hours!\n\nMore experienced non-SVS friend: Sigh. I know. Everyone here has Silicon Valley syndrome like WHOA.",

      "definition": "Snob Ball is what soccer is transformed into, when its national governing body (in a country like Australia, Canada, USA etc) decides to abandon the word \"Soccer\" and tries to hijack the word \"Football\". Not just in spite of the fact that there is already a local game called Football, but *because* of it.\r\n\r\nYou see, in each of these countries there is an undercurrent of soccer fans with a [collective] chip on their shoulder, who resent the fact that soccer is regarded locally as a boring and weak European game, enjoyed here only by \"Children, Snobs and Hooligans\". Many of these soccer fans secretly dream of a day when the local game of Football is wiped out and forgotten. Some of them even work in the media.\r\n\r\nWhen Soccer converts to Snob Ball, it harnesses this resentment in the form of snobbery, firstly by sending out a strong signal that it is going to hijack the word \"Football\", a long-held ambition of many Soccer Snobs. Within a short space of time, [the national] soccer body changes its name, for instance from \"Soccer Australia\" to \"Football Federation Australia\". It forces all state/province and local-level soccer clubs and associations to do the same. It places slogans on television and on billboards nationwide linking Soccer with the word \"Football\". For greater effect, this may coincide with a high-profile revamp of [the national] soccer league.\r\n\r\nPlayers and officials of the sport are instructed to insert the word \"Football\" as many times into one sentence as possible when speaking to the media (even shamelessly stealing the exact name of the existing sport, for example \"[Australian Football]\" to describe [Australians] playing soccer). And a previously invisible army of Soccer Snobs does the same, in schools, workplaces and on [the internet].\r\n\r\nThrough some mixture of snobbery and commercial agreement, certain media organisations also scramble to change their policy on the word \"Football\". The end result of Snob Ball is that it becomes difficult for even the most [passionate] football fan to hear the word \"football\" without thinking about soccer.",
      "example": "Snob Ball began in Sydney in 2005 and has faced [surprisingly] little [resistance] in the [Australian] media. There is no known cure.\r\n\r\nLook out North America, Snob Ball could happen to you too some day.",

During his time, the [video game community] has changed with the appearance of Virtual Reality Nervegear. Kirito uses the Nervegear to jump into the first MMO for the system, Sword Art Online, or SAO. Shortly after entering, all 6,000 players in the game are trapped inside by the game's creator, Akihiko Kayaba. They are stuck until the game's 100 floors are cleared, and if anyone dies in-game, the Nervegear will malfunction, killing the real person. Kirito must then lead his friends and fellow gamers to escape the cursed world, and get back to reality. Many subplots have followed the main arc. It is currently in its 2nd season, and a movie is in the works.",

It is likely that he also is related to John Lennon and recently deceased NFL star safety Sean Taylor.\r\n\r\nSean Connery is said to have accepted the role of James Bond because the character of Bond is so closely related to Sean himself. (Although he denies it, many say he was highly involved in MI6 in his earlier years.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most prevalent rumors involving Sir Connery's Knighthood is that the Queen Knighted him largely due to his stunning linguistic and negotiation skills during the Cuban Missile Crisis. As an experienced MI6 operative at that time, he persuaded the Soviet Union and the [United States] to ease off on the ongoing hostilities, preventing a possible third World War. After this [accomplishment] he decided to end is MI6 career and go full-fledged into the film industry.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, Sean Connery never has pizza delivered to him. He just eats Digiorno.

We have bs policies like UNIFORMS, no headphones even if we are just chillin in the courtyard not bothering anyone, and you can dye your hair the rainbow but you can’t get on your phone at all apparently.

      "defid": 1819450,
      "definition": "Spiritual Satanism, like \"Traditional Satanism,\" differs from LaVeyan Satanism. We are aware of the existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an “archetype.” \r\n\r\nMany Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him as a friend and do not worship. We respect [individuality] and personal choices. One's [relationship] with Satan/Lucifer is up to the individual, as Satanism values free thought and [individuality]. \r\n\r\nSatan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is to apply this knowledge. Spiritual Satanists do not just talk the talk about becoming a god; we work at it every day. Satan and his Demons guide us to use abilities we never even knew we had. We accomplish this through power meditation. \r\n\r\nUnlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question everything. Satan is the bringer of knowledge and enlightenment. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's brains to their maximum potential. \r\nSpiritual Satanism does not in any way conflict with science. We strongly encourage and support all scientific knowledge and enquiry. We are well aware humanity is dangerously behind in scientific knowledge and [understanding] due to centuries of oppression by [Christianity]. We believe that all spiritual and paranormal phenomena can be scientifically explained in a rational manner; scientific knowledge has not yet progressed far enough to comprehend or explain much of the so-called \"supernatural.\" \r\n\r\nThere are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism. We strongly encourage our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for guidance and support only. One's [relationship] with Satan is between that individual and Satan. We take the stance of \"[responsibility] to the responsible.\" We place no limitations on knowledge or personal power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed \"elite\" as with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct experience. \r\n\r\nMost Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his people to live life to the fullest and to evolve. \r\n\r\nSatan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to handle things as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers. [Christianity] and other it s other related religions make cripples out of people. Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people. These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to, nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene only taught slavery and servitude; how to take abuse, never anything to advance humanity. Any healings have been very few and far between; the nefarious aliens being pressed to put make a show every now and then. With the New Age practitioners, many call upon angels for assistance and learn nothing. The same theme of human ignorance and powerlessness prevails. \r\n\r\nSatan gives us the knowledge to become independent and free. He directs us to be masters of our own lives and destinies. Satan and his Demons are always there to help us when there are things we cannot yet handle. \r\n\r\nSatan keeps his promises; he is consistent and loving with his own. Satan stands for freedom, strength, power, and justice. Satan shows us it is NOT OK for us to take abuse. He shows us that we are deserving of pleasure, happiness and a better life. Satan/Lucifer is the True Creator God of, and [the great liberator] of humanity. He created us through genetic engineering, the same as scientists are now creating clones and working with genetics, but only on a much more advanced level. \r\n\r\nMany people disregard so-called “occult” power, they do not take it seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries. Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the populace. Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam, knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found. \r\n\r\nCities, libraries and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and banished. \r\n\r\nHumanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has devolved ever since. The abuse of children, animals, careless destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other living creatures are somoe of the effects of spiritual degeneration. Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity, humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as \"The Golden Age.\" \r\n\r\nSatan is the Sumerian God known as \"EA\" or \"ENKI.\" He is a GOD, not an angel! He has been denigrated and slandered through the centuries with falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away from Satan. \r\n\r\nSatan is the most brilliant of the Gods. He also ruled Egypt under the name \"PTAH.\" \"ENKI\" means Lord/Ruler of the Earth. He is symbolized by the Water Bearer of the sign of Aquarius, the 11th sign of the Zodiac. Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One of Satan's numbers is 11. \r\n\r\nSatan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also known as \"The Brotherhood of the Snake.\" Through the millennia, the teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power. This knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for nefarious ends under the direction of the entities known as “jehova” and company. To reveal these well-kept secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would no longer retain their power. \r\n\r\nThe Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings of which Satan is supreme and omnipresent. In the Christian bible, they are referred to as the \"Nephilim.\" These beings are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age. They exist out in the cosmos. \"Hell\" is out in the cosmos in the area known as \"The Duat.\" Azazel relates that “Hell” is near the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. \r\n\r\nIn the Necronomicon (this book is based upon Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of fiction), the phrase: \"When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky\" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will return. \r\n\r\nHumanity’s sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered children with human mothers These offspring were known as \"Demi-Gods.\" “Noah” (his real name was Ziusudra) was a son of Satan. Satan saved his life, along with his family, by relating to him information concerning the impending flood. This same catastrophe possibly wiped out the dinosaurs, millions of years earlier. Nibiru (the home planet of the Gods), is said to return to the asteroid belt every 3,600 years. Because of the immense size and [gravitational pull] of the planet, the Antarctic ice cap slips creating torrential rains and flooding. This is where in the Christian bible, it is written, \"the Sun will become black as sack cloth and the Moon will become blood red.\" Nibiru will eclipse the Earth. \r\n\r\nSexual relations with and intermarriage with humans angered the other Gods who looked down upon humanity and wished for our destruction. Interbreeding with the Gods gave humans capabilities that they had not intended for us to have. Father Satan wished for us to have equality with the Gods. \r\n\r\nSatan is incredibly strong, brilliant, and powerful. He refused to admit defeat. He lost a battle, but not the war. Since then, many others have defected from the tyranny of the enemy to join Satan in his fight. Satan has become, once again, extremely powerful. In spite of smaller numbers, he is winning. As Satanists, we can feel his strength. Christians are weak because their energy is used and manipulated by “Jehova” and they remain ignorant. One Satanist is worth many Christians. SATAN/LUCIFER STANDS FOR [FREEDOM FROM] TYRANNY! \r\n\r\nDOES SATAN REALLY EXIST? \r\nYes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us know of his presence. If you doubt whether he exists, just ask him. \r\n\r\nDemons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual attention and protection, once a strong and trusted [relationship] is established. When we are close to, and under the protection of Satan, he gives us good Demons to work with. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the helpful Demons Satan provides us with, angels are cruel, unfeeling, sadistic, and evil beings who look down upon humanity. One only needs to look at the Christian bible, especially the book of revelation. Angels have repeatedly been messengers of misfortune and instigators of mass murder. \r\nMany times, beings and entities from the Christian “god” will masquerade as Demons, or spirits of Satan. Remember, the Christian “god” uses ignorance and fear to enslave humanity. People who are open to Christianity or actual Christians are the most vulnerable to negative influences. Some who investigate Satanism and the occult have a bad or terrifying experience, go running back to Christianity, more holy than ever before, and rant about how \"evil\" Satan is, when all along it was the Christian god and his angelss, frightening them back into the fold. This is because they lack the necessary knowledge. Fear is one of the most effective tools used by the Christian “god.” Fear is only effective if there is a lack of knowledge. \r\n\r\nSatan is not \"evil,\" nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. One only needs to look to the Christian bible, to see all of the curses, punishments, and afflictions their so-called \"God\" has inflicted upon humanity. Now here is real abuse of psychic power, and those who do not stop to think are deluded into believing humanity is not worthy of it. Jehova uses black magick to enslave and inflict suffering upon humans and many others. \r\n\r\nSatan has given us modern medicine (whose sign is the serpent), while it is not yet perfect, it has saved many lives and healed billions of people. Satan has given us knowledge that has elevated humanity above that of an animal. All modern conveniences and technology are from Satan as well as spiritual knowledge that give us true power and advance our souls. Satanism stands for the balance of spirituality with technology. Without this balance, civilizations eventually collapse. \r\n\r\n“Hell” is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close to Satan, have seen “Hell.” We all seem to have had the same experiences. Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in other places there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color. I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, [playing cards]. The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. \r\n\r\nSATANIC SACRAMENTS \r\n\r\nWith Christianity, one is expected to give their soul without question. Infants are baptized; children around six years of age are given communion and there are no informed choices. [Little children] say bedtime prayers, asking the Christian \"god\" to take their souls, if they \"die before they wake.\" First of all YOUR SOUL IS YOU and ONLY YOU should have a right to do with it, as YOU see fit. No one should have the right to demand your soul, as have the Christians and their \"god” for centuries. Christians are forever preaching the concept of \"free will,\" but are nothing but a bunch of liars and hypocrites as they are the most aggressive violaters of \"free will\" and always have been, with centuries of resorting to torture and mass murder to coerce people into worshipping their \"god.\" \r\n\r\nThe arrogant Christian god, which is really more than one entity as we can see with the new age movement, (angels are beginning to reveal themselves and their appearance is far different than the white winged beings most people believe they are seeing), in his degrading attitude towards humanity, feels he is entitled. Souls are harvested for energy if deemed fit. \r\n\r\nMany Satanists dedicate their souls to Satan, as I have. There are reasons for this. In truth, the soul we save is our own. Satan guides us and empowers us to advance to a higher spiritual level where we are no longer enslaved with ignorance. Deluded, foolish Christians can pray for us and harass all they want to. In truth, the “saved” campaign is nothing more than another deception and lie. The Nazarene was invented to keep people from saving their own souls. He is and has been nothing more than a distraction to keep humanity from advancing spiritually. Christians are deluded into believing they will be miraculously saved by the Nazarene who was nothing more than a human blood sacrifice for “Jehova”. They are deluded into doing nothing spiritually and most know nothing about their souls. \r\n\r\nWe are under Satan's protection. Satan is very protective of his people. Disciples of Satan don't have to ride around in a bullet proof armored personnel carrier, like the Catholic Pope. Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey and other high profile Satanists have died of natural causes in spite of having a plethora of enemies. \r\n\r\nOnce a commitment is made, Satan begins investing in you. Most Satanists are extremely evolved compared to outsiders. Many non-Satanists are into the occult and are stuck at square one when it comes to [understanding], knowledge, and ability. They often meet with disaster, because they lack the necessary spiritual protection. Jehova and his angels are serious about working to stop humans from advancing. \r\n\r\nAs opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way about blood sacrifice. This is of Jehova and can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The serpent/snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened. We have our own power, and do not need outside sources as does “Jehova” and company.",

With their exclusive parties the SD in UCSD might as well stands for [Socially Dead].

It is [that time of the year] where UCSD students actually engage in human contact with another human being specifically trying to make money off of the free wristbands they received. This special day is when the word sobriety leaves each students pocket dictionary. All kinds of drugs could easily be seen in any random student’s system. Recently the festival has been divided into 2 stages. The main stage is where the bigger performers are [usually] seen which is filled with starstrucked students trying to get a closer look at the one and only popular artist on the line up. Meanwhile the dance stage usually has a few famous electro music artists filled with students gathered up in circles too fucked up on ecstasy (or not) to realize what they’re doing is not exactly shuffling.

Primarily used by teenagers and 20-somethings as a verb, the word \"saw\" is used in reference to partying or engaging in behaviour related to partying, drinking, and other [recreational] activites with friends. Oftentimes, the term is used as a synonym for more common partying phrases such as: rage, jam, bender, party, etc. While principally employed as a verb, \"to saw\" and its various incarnations can be used as adverbs or, in rare cases, nouns. Some of the alternatives to the intransitive \"to saw\" include, but are not limited to, the following: saw, sawing, sawed, sawing-it-off, sawed-out, sawmill, sawdust, etc. For example, \"sawdust\" may be used to describe the intended (or unintended) [consequences] of a night of \"sawing\" (i.e. the mess, clutter, and general aftermath left in the wake of a devastatingly amazing party). While the term itself has many applications, its growing [usage] and [popularity] amongst Canadian youth will undoubteduly continue to manifest new variations and plays on the original \"to saw.\"",
      "example": "Sawing-it-off: \"I can't believe we grabbed 8 kegs. We are really going to saw-it-off tonight.\"\n\nTo saw (saw/sawing): \"It's been a long week bro.

It had been a [particularly] bad day for Sir Sepos, and having taken enough ridicule for his long hair, Sir Sepos wrestled \"Zibby\" to the the floor. Once proving his dominance, Sir Sepos, in his frustration and lack of anything better to do, dangled his long hair [in the face] of \"Big Zib.\" Meanwhile, \"Zibby\" cried out in what appeared to be physical pain.\n\nSince the battle between \"Zibby\" and Sir Sepos, other long haired men have adopted the ritual of quickly turning their head, and slapping people [in the face] with their long hair, when insulted about their hair.",

There are different colours [available], but the most common is black, and the shorts can be either solid or shiny depending on the material used. Spats are popular with girls who are either physically active or have a tomboyish sense of fashion.\n\nSpats can also alternatively be worn as panties by wearing them without [underwear] underneath, and then worn with either a skirt or another pair of shorts over them. In media such as anime and [video games], they are used as a way to skirt around the problem of unwanted panty shots which is especially prevalent in female characters who frequently perform high kicks in fight scenes. However, there is a sizeable group of people who find black spandex shorts more arousing than your standard pantsu, thus ironically defeating the point of such modest garments similar to the way people find pantyhose sexy.\n\nWhile the two are similar, spats should not be confused with [booty shorts], which sometimes come in loose variants.

Often this is done by having specific tables hosted on specific servers, with a function determining which server contains the [information] being requested.\n\nSharding is frequently discussed with regard to large web based applications, but is not limited to any particular industry.\n\nAs a practical example, a WordPress MultiSite [installation] hosting several hundred thousand blogs could have the tables for sites 1-100,000 running on one database server 100,001-200,000 on another or 200,001+ on a third. An [alternative] sharding [implementation] could be to have the 50 busiest blogs' tables split between the first two servers all remaining blog data on the third server. Likewise, data could be partitioned based upon the geographic location of the web servers delivering each blog.",

Sailors are likely the vectors who introduced syphilis to Europe where it became known as \"The Pox\", was essentially untreatable and the source of much misery and suffering.\n\n\"Tattooed\" refers to the fact that sailors, at certain times in history, were marked so that they would not be press ganged into service in Navys other than their own. Sailors in those times were essentially \"property\". The very act of tattooing, done by one sailor to another, [generally] ensured the further transmission of syphilis, even in the absence of \"Screwed\". Tattoo's became synonymous with syphilis. Those with tattoo's were to be physically avoided, due to the possibility of cantagion.\n\nAnd if, when you're a little boy, [your grandmother] takes you by the hand and drags you away from someone with a tattoo while telling you to \"stay clear of that filthy tattooed man\", it sticks with you.",

      "defid": 2447392,
      "definition": "A [white supremacist], which many non-racist skinheads call a BONEHEAD instead of a skinhead.\r\n\r\nThese are [White Supremacists] who are too young and/or stupid (\"boneheaded\") to comprehend the history of skinhead culture and its connection to BLACK (Negro) culture, and the significance of the following historical facts which make \"[white supremacist] skinhead\" a complete oxymoron.\r\n\r\nHere are 6 crucial facts about skinhead history...\r\n1. Symarip's song called \"SKINHEAD moonstomp\" was copyrighted in 1969.\r\n2. Every member of Symarip was BLACK (Negro) with a shaved head and...\r\n3. This 1969 song BY BLACK SKINHEADS has the lyrics: \"I want all you skinheads to get up on your feet, PUT YOUR BRACES TOGETHER AND YOUR BOOTS ON YOUR FEET...\"). <--THESE ARE THE SAME BOOTS-n-BRACES THAT BONEHEADS WEAR TO THIS DAY.\r\n\r\n4. Even Tom Metzger (a racist leader) himself admitted in his Larry King interview that the first RACIST skins didn't come along till 1978 or so -- a decade after Symarip and the other original skinheads -- as recruited/[propagandized] by the racist [National Front] group.\r\n5. Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary lists \"skinhead\" as working-class youths (no mention of racism) and Webster's denotes that the word \"skinhead\" was coined in 1965 -- about 15 years earlier than Metzger himself says the first so-called \"Nazi skins\" came about.\r\n6. See also tradskin.com and trojanrecords.com.  See also traditional skinhead in [urban dictionary] or wikipedia, etc.).\r\n\r\nAnd here is an analysis of those 6 facts...\r\nSo far, what we can say from the above 6 facts is that a Neo-Nazi (Metzger, a total bonehead...), non-Nazi skins, the USA copyright office (which protects Symarip's songs), and hell even the dictionary.... ALL AGREE that the real (original) Skinheads, who CREATED the word skinhead and the skinhead culture -- even the mode of dress, which skinheads use to this day -- \r\nincluded BLACKS (Negros),\r\nbut DID NOT INCLUDE [WHITE SUPREMACISTS] (as Metzger himself attested to Larry King).\r\n\r\nWe also know that these original skins -- even the white ones -- were playing SKA music invented by BLACKS (Negros) from the Caribbean. (see websites immediately above.)\r\n\r\nAnd so, here is the first reason they get called boneheads:\r\nIf they REALLY think the White Race is supreme, they wouldn't emulate Negros or want anything to do with the skinhead subculture which BLACKS like Symarip and BLACK CULTURE (eg. ska) primarily created... They thought this Black culture was better than any and all White cultures they COULD have chosen to emulate.\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\nThe boneheads wear boots-n-braces, just as the NEGRO lead singer of Symarip instructed all skinheads to do in the 1969 lyrics I copied above... In doing so, they are taking directions on how to dress themselves, from a BLACK man (Symarip's singer). bwa-hhahhahhhaaahhhha, how to DRESS themselves!\r\nIF YOU ARE A REAL [WHITE SUPREMACIST], THEN WHY ARE YOU EMULATING AND TAKING ORDERS FROM THIS BLACK MAN (lead singer of Symarip)?  Because your mommy isn't there to dress you?!\r\n\r\nWhat sort of [White Supremacist] follows and complies when a Black dude tells them to do ANYTHING? Symarip's singer says skins should wear boots-n-braces (and the original Black skins, generally, decided upon this \"uniform\"), so these supposed \"supreme\" whiteys do EXACTLY what [the Black man] says and wear boots-n-braces. Do you always act like submissive bitches to a Black man like Symarip's singer, and do exactly what he says? hhhhhahhhahahaaahahahaa.\r\nWhat self-respecting [White Supremacist] LETS a Black man tell them what to do?\r\n.....Answer: a very STUPID [White Supremacist], or possibly a masochist who wants to humiliate himself and his beliefs. :-)\r\n\r\nReason #3:\r\nMost of us non-racist skins just don't want to be associated with the NAZI image when non-skinheads see us, so we won't even call them SKINheads (only BONEheads) so we can TAKE BACK OUR CULTURE: my father was an original 1960's skin, I'm a tradskin, and hopefully in a few years my kids will be (only 5 years old is the oldest...but 3 generations of skin will be great :-) ).\r\n\r\n......The facts above (labeled 1 thru 6) make it quite clear that the racists are hijacking skinhead culture.  But look at the competing definition on this webpage by the so-called \"patriot\"-bird, because like any good Nazi, she wants to revise history and hijack the TRUE (original, mostly-BLACK) skinhead culture.",
      "example": "\"These shitbird Boneheads just sit around shouting \"skinhead 88!\" and dream of having Hitler's [National Socialism] right here in America; to do that, they need to defeat the MULTI-ETHNIC Marines, because 60 [years] ago we defeated the stinkin Nazi's/National [Socialists]. Patriots???!these traitors woulda fought for GERMANY in WWII. And even today, Boneheads fight against the VAST MAJORITY of Americans who believe in [racial equality]... A \"skinhead 88\" fights AGAINST OTHER AMERICANS, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING *FOR ALL* AMERICANS, which is another reason they are not AMERICAN patriots, they are patriotic toward HITLER and his values, not patriotic toward modern America.  Those cowardly [pseudo-patriot] Boneheads like PatriotByrd cannot even JOIN the Marines, because they wouldn't be able to deal with the need to work and fight next to (NOT AGAINST) Black, Latino, Jewish, and Oriental AMERICAN SOLDIERS (BRAVE patriots). I also can't see most Boneheads being swift enough to survive if they fight in s(h)ituations where they are a lot more likely to die than \"10 Nazis attacking 1 old lady,\" and operating anything bigger than kiddie weapons like DAO handguns (as boneheads, not sure they'd be able to work our latest weapons even if they joined USMC).  America is not just the land, WE THE PEOPLE ARE ALL part of America and ALL races have worked to keep America strong, thus we ARE America....and Boneheads want to fight against America itself: us.\"",

When multiple players join a single game online, one player's XBOX is chosen to be the \"host\" of the game. All other players' XBOX's must [communicate] [information] with the host's. When there is high ping or lag, the delay in the transer of [information] can create problems in-game. It is not uncommon that the host will have a slight advantage over other players when buttons or actions are performed at almost the same time, especially in game types such as \"Grifball\" or \"SWAT\" which depend largely upon attacking at exactly the right moment to beat one's opponent. After-game statistics in Grifball games often reveal which player had \"host\" when most players' kill-to-death ratio is very negative or near zero but the host's ratio is extremely positive regardless of the skill of the players. The host experiences no delay in the processing of [information] (he has no lag) and therefore can often attack before his opponent (as far as the game is concerned). [Even if] both players press their buttons at exactly the same time in \"RL\" (Real Life), the player with host presses it first because non-host players' \"button-press\" of [information] must travel to the host's XBOX before the game acknowledges it. \r\n\r\nIn Grifball and SWAT the team with host almost always wins when latency is high. The term \"sick host\" describes such a situation. When one team can consistently kill players of the other team regardless of skill, but only because of having host and not experiencing lag, it is said that they have \"sick host.\" \"Sick\" is colloquial modifier similar to 'awesome' which here greatly amplifies 'host.' \r\n\r\nWhichever team has the player who has host does not [necessarily] win, but if a team has \"sick host\" there is no possible way for the opposing team to win. Playing a team with \"sick host\" is extremely [frustrating] and annoying because the game is never fair, and non-host players must suffer being \"pwnd\" for the duration of the game.",
      "example": "Red [Team Player]: \"Dude! I just head-shotted this guy when he came [around the corner] but he somehow killed me and didn't die!\"\r\n\r\n[Red Team] Teammate: \"I know dude. He's got SICK HOST. Every time I run into that guy we both shoot at the same time but he always kills me.\"",

It's great for a cloudy night.\r\n\r\n2. Gary Glitter is a glam rock superstar of the 70s and 80s. He's scored a tally of hits, the most famous one is probably \"Rock'N'Roll Part 2\", which is chanted by crowds at stadium events all over the planet. In 1999 he left his computer at a shop for repairs and on the hard disk a massive database of [kiddie porn] was discovered. He spent a few months in  prison in his native UK, then headed to Cuba in disgrace. He later packed up and went to Cambodia. He was kicked out of that country for sexual perversion (that's bad). He then settled in Vietnam and bought a house there. Some neighbors saw him frollicking in a [swimming pool] with some [Vietnamese] girls, some as young as 10. Then he took them inside, you can guess the rest. He was arrested, the police found some more kiddie smut on his laptop and he was sentenced to a few years behind bars. He shouted, \"Do [you know who] I am?\" during the trial. Well, yes we do know. He's a pervert and a child molester and a sick twisted fuck.",
