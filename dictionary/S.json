      "definition": "Scousers are an [interesting] result of the [industrial revolution] and Liverpool is a true immigrant city equalled only with London, New York and Buenos Aires. Most Scousers are of Irish and Welsh descent though the city has long standing Chinese, West African and Scandinavian communities with the term 'Scouser' coming from the dish 'Lobscouse' which is a bastardization of the Norwegian word 'labskaus' which is a Norwegian lamb/mutton stew.\r\n\r\nI have read a lot of the enteries on here and knowing the city and a lot of the people I feel I can make a decent unbiased job of writing a fair review about Liverpool.\r\n\r\nScousers are famous for the [sense of humour], though they can laugh at others and do so regulary, they cannot laugh at themselves, any joke about Liverpool is taken as a great insult, Scousers tend to have a [victimized]/martyrdom complex but despite this they are capable of great acts of charity and benevolence. Scousers more often than not employ a disarming but [superficial] friendliness to strangers - it is only when you get to know a Scouser that they start to grate.\r\n\r\nScousers have a 'big man' complex, most Scousers are not physically big nor physically hard though they are able to intimdate people through shouting at them with a guttural accent that has changed a lot in the past 30 years so they can sound more tough. Scousers can be violent and aggresive but the vast majority cannot fight to save their life - another paradox of [this is that] Liverpool is a famous amateur boxing city and has produced many fighters in the lighter weight divsions though never a really good big man and they never will due to the typical Scousers puny physique.\r\n\r\nThe 'Big Man' complex is more apparent in the workplace, Scousers as a rule loath to work but when forced to put in a days graft, Scousers all want to be the boss - 99.9% of them aren't capable of bossing a lemming over the cliff but their attitude to earning a honest living means they aren't receptive to working 8 hours a day under the orders of someone else - strikes and [industrial action] is still common in Liverpool even in these fraught times - Scousers therefore like to go into small business such as [window cleaning] and market stall trading and the shadier ones go into petty crime such as burgulary, drug dealing etc.\r\n\r\nLiverpool is a great city in many ways that has inspired great artists,\r\nwriters, poets and musicians and is [one of the most] aestheically beautiful architectural cities in the world - however Scousers have a [love hate relationship] with Manchester - a horrid shit tip 30 miles away - It is lost on the majority of Scousers that the Mancunian is the most closest thing to a Scouser you can get in look, attitude and lifestyle. Scousers are nothing like Geordies or Glaswegians like they purport to be, but the Scouser and the Mancunian is an near identical animal.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you will never ever hear a Scouser saying is 'Oh! I never/didn't know that?' Scousers know [everything] about anything. A Scouser will never admit to not knowing about any subject on planet earth and is quite capable of telling a [brain surgeon] how to do thier job despite the fact the Scouser in question might be a milkman or a doley or something equally as tragic.\r\n\r\nScousers have a highly developed and protective sense of self, they are proud to be born in the city and any 'Texan' 'Plazzy' or 'Wool' who claims to be [one of them] is going to get the heave ho before long, they are not tolerant of non Scousers claiming to be Scousers. \r\n\r\nEven the good people of Birkenhead, Kirkby, Huyton and Skem are seen as 'plazzies' even though the rest of the planet see them as Scousers. It is a complex state of affairs. (If you are from Skem that is!)\r\n\r\nThe true Scouse accent is Celtic in origin, it is a mixture of Welsh, Irish and Lancastrian dialects, the lilting sounds of John Lennon have now been replaced by the rasping, guttural sound\r\nof the Scouser of today - apparentley \r\nTVs Eastenders is the biggest influence in the change of the accent over the past 30 years!\r\n\r\nLiverpool has a higher ratio of beautiful women than in other parts of the UK down to the high racial mixing \r\nof the populace - its is not uncommon for your bog standard Scouser to have a \r\nSomalian/Paraguayan/Egypt ian/Burmese etc grandparent or great grandparent which leads to attractive women - though their attractivness is negated by their big mouths and bad attitudes - mind you\r\nthey have been dealing with their male [counterparts] since birth so I can [understand] it but I wouldn't want any part of it!\r\n\r\nI could do a piece about the football but a) It has been covered ad nauseum and b) I would have to mention Heysel and the pre 1989 'Munich 58' song.",

To that end, the term has recieved a connotation that all perons living in southern California are rich, white, asshole, cokeheads.  While this might describe a vast majority of costal community dwellers, it tends to incorporate others who just like the area and say \"fuckoff\" to those rich asshole fuckers.  San Diego, being the farthest south does not have as many of the costal pricks as say, Laguna Beach, or areas of LA that tend to have a lot of coke and rich pricks. ANd just as a reference, [northern california] has the best weed and if you disagree you've never been there. Also Norcal is not any better than Socal it just has fewer people and more trees.

Several of their songs on radio stations throughout Eastern Kentucky. Their original music has them performing at the best venues in Lexington such as A1A, The [Cadillac Ranch] and The Kentucky Theater.\r\n\r\nTwo of the many potential hits on the album,[FRANKENSTEIN] and DAY BY DAY have attracted the attention of SHOWHOUSE PRODUCTIONS LLC resulting the filming of two music videos. STITCH RIVET has also performed alongside national acts such as Drowning Pool, Bobaflex, Seven Mary Three and Nappy Roots.\r\n\r\nThe group was also included high on the roster of bands performing at the first annual Gateway Music Festival in September of 2007 and at the 2007 Poage Landing Days Festival in Ashland, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWith blues, metal, and jazz as a basis for their influence, they compose their songs with simple [complexity] to give a warm depth to the creation.

However, following British colonization of Tasmania in 1803, their habitats were destroyed and many Squilliams were hunted down for their [expensive] furs. The result was brutal fighting between British colonizers and guerilla tribes of Squilliams, armed with whatever they could find. At first, the less-equipped Squilliams struggled with their oppressors, who wielded advanced firearms and horses. However, Squilliams were able to make use of their habitat, which the British colonizers were not familiar with. The British government was no match for these ravenous beasts and were forced to withdraw from the sporadic fighting. Today, Squilliams can once again live free in their homeland and graze on the rich grasses of Tasmania, free from British [oppression].",

I get dirty looks from people when I play ska in the car or on my stereo, especially when they hear the horn section (tends to induce a WHAT-THE-FUCK-ARE-YOU-LISTENING-TO?!\" response) And it's funny, if I take the time to play the band \"Cake\" before a ska song, people are suddenly reminded that having a horn section in a band isn't a reason to tell the DJ to go fuck himself/herself.

Is your knee still bouncing?\n\n*Do you make over $75,000 a year yet still find yourself wearing Vans/New Balance shoes and graphic t-shirts at work and during your free-time?\n\n*Do you shun traditional social gatherings that require that you interact with non-intellectual scum (read: non-academics that have 9-5's and/or lowly humanity degrees) and that requires that you shave/brush your teeth/switch out one Stanford sweatshirt for another?\n\n*Do you have multiple food/pet/medication allergies that require you to keep an EpiPen in the glovebox of your leased Accord?",

      "definition": "Snob Ball is what soccer is transformed into, when its national governing body (in a country like Australia, Canada, USA etc) decides to abandon the word \"Soccer\" and tries to hijack the word \"Football\". Not just in spite of the fact that there is already a local game called Football, but *because* of it.\r\n\r\nYou see, in each of these countries there is an undercurrent of soccer fans with a [collective] chip on their shoulder, who resent the fact that soccer is regarded locally as a boring and weak European game, enjoyed here only by \"Children, Snobs and Hooligans\". Many of these soccer fans secretly dream of a day when the local game of Football is wiped out and forgotten. Some of them even work in the media.\r\n\r\nWhen Soccer converts to Snob Ball, it harnesses this resentment in the form of snobbery, firstly by sending out a strong signal that it is going to hijack the word \"Football\", a long-held ambition of many Soccer Snobs. Within a short space of time, [the national] soccer body changes its name, for instance from \"Soccer Australia\" to \"Football Federation Australia\". It forces all state/province and local-level soccer clubs and associations to do the same. It places slogans on television and on billboards nationwide linking Soccer with the word \"Football\". For greater effect, this may coincide with a high-profile revamp of [the national] soccer league.\r\n\r\nPlayers and officials of the sport are instructed to insert the word \"Football\" as many times into one sentence as possible when speaking to the media (even shamelessly stealing the exact name of the existing sport, for example \"[Australian Football]\" to describe [Australians] playing soccer). And a previously invisible army of Soccer Snobs does the same, in schools, workplaces and on [the internet].\r\n\r\nThrough some mixture of snobbery and commercial agreement, certain media organisations also scramble to change their policy on the word \"Football\". The end result of Snob Ball is that it becomes difficult for even the most [passionate] football fan to hear the word \"football\" without thinking about soccer.",
      "example": "Snob Ball began in Sydney in 2005 and has faced [surprisingly] little [resistance] in the [Australian] media. There is no known cure.\r\n\r\nLook out North America, Snob Ball could happen to you too some day.",

It is likely that he also is related to John Lennon and recently deceased NFL star safety Sean Taylor.\r\n\r\nSean Connery is said to have accepted the role of James Bond because the character of Bond is so closely related to Sean himself. (Although he denies it, many say he was highly involved in MI6 in his earlier years.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most prevalent rumors involving Sir Connery's Knighthood is that the Queen Knighted him largely due to his stunning linguistic and negotiation skills during the Cuban Missile Crisis. As an experienced MI6 operative at that time, he persuaded the Soviet Union and the [United States] to ease off on the ongoing hostilities, preventing a possible third World War. After this [accomplishment] he decided to end is MI6 career and go full-fledged into the film industry.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, Sean Connery never has pizza delivered to him. He just eats Digiorno.
