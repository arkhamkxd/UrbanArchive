The guitars are often tuned to D or open D to get that low sound of metal-like distortion that the standard E tuning doesn't offer.  The term \"stoner rock\" most likely comes from the perceived [association] of smoking marijuana and the fans of this music.  However, smoking marijuana is not necessary to enjoy the music.  These are some of the bands considered to be stoner rock:  T-Rex, Kyuss, [Monster Magnet], Wolfmother, Black Sabbath, Fu Manchu, QOTSA.",

Though students typically travel in from affluent suburbs, they like to think going to Ignatius gives them \"street-cred\" and makes them \"city-smart,\" which it most certainly does not. While these sheltered students try to shed the soft, pampered reputation they have received, the fact remains that there are chandeliers in the cafeteria and the buildings are nicer than many on collegiate campuses.\n\nTry as they might, no Ignatius athletic teams seem to be able to have consistent success. Though their parents always by their children top-of-the-line equipment, athleticism is rare and has lead to Ignatius' reputation as a\"guaranteed win.\" This is evident in the annual Fenwick/Ignatius [football game] where Ignatius will usually lose by a deficit of at least 35 points. Even as Ignatius boasts itself as an \"academic powerhouse,\" their Math and Science teams consistently prove inferior to other prep schools, including bitter rival Fenwick, who also outshines them on standardized test scores.\n\nKnown for having below average-looking women, the social scene is also lacking. A typical weekend for any Ignatius student usually consists of stealing Bacardi Razz or Malibu Rum from one's parents and sneaking it into a party in a [water bottle]. After each consuming the equivalent of two or three shots, students generally become [intoxicated] and resort to bizarre homoerotic behavior including, but not limited to: applying body glitter, dancing to [Jonas Brothers], wearing black leather, watching reruns of Ellen, etc. This [metrosexuality] is also also exemplified by the clothing worn by students, including brands such as [American Eagle], Abercrombie, Hollister, etc. Many Ignatius boys like using hair gel to mold a faux-hawk or spend 20 minutes on creating that \"just-rolled-out-of-bed look.\" Pooka shells, Kanye West sunglasses, Birkenstocks, stud earrings, destroyed/paint-stained jeans, designer graphic tees, and many other types of extremely lame clothing are staples in the daily Ignatius outfit.\n\nYes, while the douchebags of Ignatius sit smugly in their ivory towers, the rest of Chicagoland, and the country, has a laugh at their expense.",

The current structure includes more than 8,200 undergraduates at more than 225 chapters in 47 states and Canada. Alumni are active in more than 75 alumni associations.\r\n\r\nGovernance Structure: The organization is governed through a five-person executive board (Supreme Council) that is elected at biennial conventions. An [executive director] (Eminent Supreme Recorder) supervises a staff of [approximately] 28 at the Fraternity Service Center in Evanston, Illinois, and eight regional directors. The [United States] and Canada are divided into 29 regions (provinces) overseen by regional volunteers called province archons. Each chapter is required to have an active chapter adviser.\r\n\r\nSigma Alpha Epsilon Foundation: The SAE Foundation was established in 1927 to create programs that promote the highest ideals of academic and [personal development]. The existing programs include named [scholarships], a student-loan program and the [international] Leadership School that has produced more than 38,000 graduates. The SAE Foundation awards $69,000 in scholarships annually in support of its mission.\r\n\r\nProminent Alumni: [William McKinley], Elliot Ness, [David Spade], Phil Jackson, Dennis Erickson, William Faulkner, Joe Foss, Bob Ballard, General Richard Myers, Ernie Harwell, Tony Boselli, Bo Schembechler, Nick Lachey, Fred Savage, Pete Carroll, Mack Brown\r\n\r\nFast Facts: SAE is North America’s largest social fraternity with more than 280,000 initiated members. Fraternal symbols include the lion, the phoenix, Minerva, and the fleur-de-lis. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was the first fraternity to establish a national headquarters (1929), a national Leadership School (1935), a national Men’s Health Issues Committee (1980), and a career-development program entitled the Leading Edge (1990). Currently, the Fraternity offers a comprehensive member-education program called The True Gentleman Initiative. The Fraternity communicates through The Record magazine, a quarterly publication that has been published continuously since 1880. New members receive a copy of The Phoenix pledge manual for educational development.\r\n\r\nOur Creed: The True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his [inferiority] or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.\r\n-John Walter Wayland",

Michael often notes that full 1's and 10's are [particularly] rare.\n\nThe numbers are as follows:\r\n1 - Completely straight: only ever enjoyed porn with just singular women in it, or lesbians. If you've ever seen a man naked while erect, you are immediately bumped [up to] a...\n\n2 - Mostly straight: has enjoyed porn with naked men in it , even though the main focus of the viewer was on the woman in the porn\n\n(2.5 - Pretty straight: has enjoyed porn with mostly-female hermaphrodites in it)\n\n3 - Moderately straight: has enjoyed porn with mostly-female transexuals (people born men, but surgically and often hormonally altered to resemble women) in it\n\n4 - [Slightly straight]: has enjoyed porn with mostly-convincing [transvestites] (men who only dress like women, but have not had surgery or hormones to resemble them) in it\n\ntruncated for length",

Get your friends' phone numbers and ask them to hang out sometime; see a movie, play board games, hang out at a park, share your favorite tv shows/movies, even study for school.

I want to ask her out, but since I don't hang out with people on my own initiative often, I'm worried that even if she said yes, I'd be really awkward and off-putting on a date.

Santa Clarita is also know to be super boring, bland, racist, and Karenish. Over the years, Santa Clarita has become more diverse. As for the racist people who exist in this city, it’s mostly the lower class blue collar [white people]. They mostly drive lifted trucks and sometimes rep a confederate flag on their vehicles. Mostly garbage white people. Some of these white people you encounter may give vibes of the racial slur/term, “WHITE TRASH.” These low life [white trash people] are just bitter and jealous they have to downplay or look down on other minorities/races and believe white people are superior. Some of them can be [white supremacists]. Just remember most racist people especially, “[white trash people],” are dumb, unsophisticated, and unintelligent. Meaning these white people are the low tier certified dumb asses who probably couldn’t graduate from COC, the community college in Santa Clarita because they are too dumb to get an AA degree. So, they probably work for a shitty blue collar job for their uncle or some garbage company. Besides that, there’s also a bunch of Karen’s that live here. Most of them are just generic average looking chicks.",

Other noticable physical characteristics include long [yellow] fingernails, a terrifying 5'oclock shadow, and rancid feet.\n\nThe Sketchy Fingers get its name from its unusual habit of rubbing its scrotum and/or asshole, then immediately sniffing its fingers. This leads to the trademark Sketchy Fingers \"confused\" facial expression from which it is most recognizable.\n\nThis creature has a high sexual drive and will fornicate with nearly any size and shape of human female as long as it doesn't have to use a condom. It tends to court females by [impersonating] an Australian doctor but will also occasionally spit its teeth, although the latter method has not been used for some time.\n\nIts eating habits include a wide variety of late night foods, ranging from pizza to leftovers from the fridge of the female which it just had sex with. The Sketchy Fingers has no natural predators (excluding male pattern baldness) but does generally shy away from competing with the [African-American] male in both athletic and female courting abilities. Notable defense mechanisms include deception, stealing, and intoxication.\n\nMost attemps at capturing the elusive Sketchy Fingers have been futile, although there is rumor that it is possible to trap it using a large Tom Brady cutout and Stroke29 [masturbation] cream.",
