She is the sexual godess all men (and some women) fantasise about, with an appetite and taste for sex that appeals to roughly everyone. She is both Madonna and the Whore, which some lucky gals and fellas will come to notice. However, she tends to [use] sex as a way to pay/repay a purchase or favor, although that seldom happens.\n\nShe most defiantly has a sugar daddy (matter of fact, she probably has a number of [sugar daddies]), but rarely dares to commit in such things as [relationships].\n\nIn conclusion, the most beautiful, perfect and exciting sin you'll ever come across in your life, a solid ten on any scale.",
