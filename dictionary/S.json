And if SPUD has not been shouted by one of the team players when the ball was hit, the opponents win one SPUDpoint (within the time frame).\n\nThese distinctive modifications to the slightly more [popular game] of Table Tennis are what define Spud Pong.\n\nWARNING: Gameplay is most enjoyable when most high.",

To be honest, one too many Side Pockets [40s] is probably the motive behind many a people becoming such dirty barnyard whores in the first place. Just ask your mom.\n\n2.
