Some programs, including Dancing Monkeys, have been made in a attempt to make stepfile creation automatic, but files created by these programs are [universally] accepted as CF (or crap file, a reference to what began as a inside joke about Cobalt Flux metal pads, which are known by their high quality).\r\nStepMania can also emulate Pump It Up (PiU, five panels arranged in a cross-shaped pattern) and ParaParaParadise (PPP, five arrows arranged in the forward, left, right, up-left and up-right positions). The StepMania codebase was used as the source for [In The Groove] (ITG), a four-panel dance game infamous for its [competition] with DDR. ITG is now owned by Konami, the producer of DDR, due to a recent lawsuit against Roxor, the producer of ITG.",
