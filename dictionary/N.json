The kids at the  high school are usually ignorant douchebags who know nothing about anything outside the shithole they call a town. Although there are exceptions, the guys at the high school think their hot shit but the reality is that they get their asses handed to them in almost every way possible. To make up for these deficiencies, they all like to show off their \"hot rods\". I hate to be the [one] who tells them this but that's not gonna get you anywhere buds. The girls at New Providence arent much better. Again there are exceptions, but [for the most part] they are artifically tanned orange pieces of mass who could care less about anything other than their skin tone. Their academics are on the decline and their sports teams are incredibly average, continually getting their asses kicked by rival, Governor Livingston of Berkely Heights. I don't even go there or live in Berkely Heights. There is [nothing to do] in town but hang outside CVS and Blockbuster in the Village Shopping Center or get stoned outside Friendly's. There are very few places to eat, and with the exception of Coppola's which does have [extraordinary] pizza, the majority of the food cannot be digested. To sum it all up, New Providence is an uncultured town that shouldn't even be compared to its neighbors Summit, Chatham and Berkely Heights (again I do not live in any of these places).",

The animal is unable to sleep [through the night] and its [sleeping pattern] is reversed from normal to that of a night shift worker. The canine can often be witnessed displaying the greatest levels of its daily energy quota after midnight, in the early hours of the morning, often seen leaping and prancing around the the yard, hunting, barking and guarding and/or bolting up and down the the fence line with great vigor. The animal will have more of a tendency towards delinquency including ignoring basic commands and destroying anything that it can get its teeth around during times of boredom. Contributing to the condition is the fact that the animal is forced to sleep during the day in direct or indirect sunlight which disturbs the [natural melatonin] cycle.

The purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people.\r\n\r\nWeapons and Gear:\r\n\r\nNinja sword\r\n[Throwing stars]\r\nNinja [outfit]\r\n\r\nTestimonial:\r\n\r\nNinjas can kill anyone they want!  Ninjas cut off heads ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so crazy and awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this ninja who was eating at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a spoon the ninja killed the whole town.  My friend Mark said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window. \r\n\r\nAnd that's what I call REAL [Ultimate Power]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \r\n\r\nIf you don't believe that ninjas have REAL [Ultimate Power] you better get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.   \r\n\r\nNinjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee).  \r\n\r\nQ and A: \r\n\r\nQ: Why is everyone so obsessed about ninjas?\r\n\r\nA: Ninjas are the [ultimate paradox]. On the one hand they don't give a crap, but on the other hand, ninjas are very careful and precise. \r\n\r\nQ: I heard that ninjas are always cruel or mean.  What's their problem?\r\n\r\nA: Whoever told you that is a total liar.  Just like other mammals, ninjas can be mean OR totally awesome.  \r\n\r\nQ: What do ninjas do when they're not cutting off heads or [flipping out]?\r\n\r\nA: Most of their free time is spent flying, but sometime they stab.

It is a form of amateur [pornographic] film which creatively cycles around the individual's desire. Often it is created by women, with some exceptions (e.g. [Christopher] Cumingham), and it has an emancipatory and often artistic quality to it, as the entire production is usually done by one person. Female collaborations within the Nu Fetish scene have been done aswell.\n\nWho exactly consumes Nu Fetish on the net, is still an unclear demographic as very little information is available.

That's who these \"keepers of the magic\" sell this stuff to. Also love how the other definition given here says they wash it so it's more pure or some crazy thing... And then the part about it only being found in Crystal form- fyi, that's the form of all lsd. That is how it comes out of the lab in Crystal form. Any other way of distributing it or using it is done by mixing the crystal form with a liquid and then using that \"wash\" to invite it into paper, gelatin, sugar cubes, [you know the drill]. Anyways it's just LSD [that's what] needlepoint is. It's a marketing scheme that the people who sell LSD came up with to try to make you think that you are getting a superior product. It's the same thing as all of the Cannabis sales people telling you that what you're getting is \"purps\" or \"cookies\" or \"sour D\" or [whatever] flavor strain is being hyped at the moment. Needlepoint: it is hype that is used to sell LSD",

      "definition": "1. Those born of parents who are citizens.\n\n2. A person born of American parents. Thus a person born abroad of American parents, according to the Constitution, would be eligible to the [office] of President.\n\n3. One whose citizenship is established by the jurisdiction which the [United States] already has over the parents of the child, not what is thereafter acquired by choice of residence in this country.\n\n4. Those persons born whose father the [United States] already has an established jurisdiction over, i.e., born to father's who are themselves citizens of the [United States].\n\n5. One who is a citizen by no act of law.\n\nIf a person owes their citizenship to some act of law, they cannot be considered a natural-born citizen. This leads us to defining natural-born citizen under the laws of nature.\n\nChildren naturally follow the condition of their fathers, and succeed to all their rights. The country of the fathers is therefore that of the children.\n\nIn order to be of the country, it is necessary that a person be born of a father who is a citizen; for, if he is born there of a foreigner, it will be only the place of his birth, and not his country. Vattel, The Law of Nations: I. XIX. § 212.\n\nThe Framers were not men who dropped words in by accident. They thought about every word. They argued about every word.\n\nBy drawing on the term so well known from English law, the Founders were recognizing the law of hereditary, rather than territorial allegiance. Alexander Porter Morse, \"Natural-Born-Citizen of the [United States]: Eligibility for the Office of President,\" Albany Law Journal, vol.66 (1904), pp. 99. The framers thought it wise, in view of the probable influx of European immigration, to provide that the President should at least be the child of citizens owing allegiance to the [United States] at the time of his birth. Morse, op. cit, p. 99.\n\nThe [presidential] eligibility clause was scarcely intended to bar the children of American parentage, whether born at sea or in foreign territory. The Founders and the first Congress, which passed the 1790 Naturalization Act, defined a \"natural born\" citizen as one whose citizenship is established by the jurisdiction which the [United States] already has over the parents of the child, not what is thereafter acquired by choice of residence in this country. Morse, op. cit., p. 99. Whoever drew the Act followed closely the various parliamentary statues of [Great Britain]; and its language in this relation indicates that the first congress entertained and declared that children of American parentage, wherever born, were within the constitutional designation, \"natural-born citizens.\" The act is declaratory: but the reason that such children are natural born remains; that is, their American citizenship is natural -- the result of parentage -- and is not artificial or acquired by compliance with legislative requirements. Morse, op. cit., p. 100.\n\nIf the Founders had not wanted an expansive definition of citizenship, it would only have been necessary to say, 'no person, except a native-born citizen.' Morse, op. cit., p. 99.\n\nIt should be noted that Morse is reluctant to accept one implication of the [dictionary definition] of \"native-born,\" namely, that it includes people born in the [United States] even if their parents are not citizens.",

The players using the Noobtube are called Noobtubers and are hated by many players in the gaming community because of the weapon requiring little effort to get kills with because of its high damage and blast radius.
