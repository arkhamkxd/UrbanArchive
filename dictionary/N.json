They don’t have any love for their victims it’s all about control because once they gain control over you they can use you to feed their grandiosity. They view people as objects that they need to give their false self attention (aka supply) so they can keep up their demonic facade.

Although Sandy Hook is classified as a separate town, it is commonly included in Newtown, seeing as people from both towns attend Newtown Middle School and Newtown High School.\r\n\r\nThe teenagers in Newtown range on and off from the popular cliche cliques. Most of what happens in this town seems like it is some television show due to the amount of people that:\r\n-smoke pot daily to [on the weekends]\r\n-come out as bisexual, gay, lesbian, or not sure\r\n-post or show pictures of nudity\r\n-lie to their parents and/or siblings\r\n-have sex or sexual encounters with a couple to many partners before graduating high school\r\n-take birth control or use condoms\r\n-end up being pregnant\r\n-have an abortion, keep their baby, suffer miscarraige, or give their baby up for adoption\r\n-get an std\r\n-perform self-mutilation (cutting, burning, bruising, etc)\r\n-end up with [mental disorder] (depression, anxiety, etc)\r\n-develop eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, overeating, etc)\r\n-drink many times per week, most of the time just to get drunk\r\n-end up in the hospital (for physical and/or mental reasons)\r\n-become severely injured\r\n-need prescription medication\r\n-cheat on their [significant other]\r\n-cheat on tests, homework, and whatnot\r\n-steal or shoplift\r\n-dye their hair (highlights, combination of colors, brown, blonde, black, red, green, blue, purple, pink, etc)\r\n-end up in therapy or having to go to a special school\r\n-become friends with many people from other towns (brookfield, hartford, shelton, danbury, redding, trumbull, etc)\r\n-spend most to all of their free time on myspace, facebook, and/or aim\r\n-walk throughout the town or hitch rides\r\n-experience their parents divorce, become ill, or pass on\r\n-become suicidal\r\n-skip classes\r\n-run away\r\n-get low self esteem\r\n-get piercings and gages (with or without parental consent; ears, belly button, eyebrows, nose, lip, tongue, facial, etc)\r\n-get tattoos underage\r\n-experiment smoking various things\r\n-experiment with many types of drugs\r\n-sell drugs\r\n-threaten someone (accidently, jokingly, purposely, etc)\r\n-obtain weapon (pocket knife, gun, etc)\r\n-use weapon\r\n-have older-aged people buy them cigarettes\r\n-smoke cigarettes underage and become addicted by or before legal age\r\n-become [attention seeking] and attempt to do something listed above\r\n-have a similar or different problem than what is listed above\r\n-not be one of the people with such common problems like listed above\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem that half to three fourths of a teenager's grade does many of those things, there are some good to well-rounded students that have thought about many of those various issues, known someone or many people with one or more of those various issues, made a decision not to do or be associated with any of those things, and try to do well in school.\r\n\r\nMany [middle schoolers] tend to walk after school to local places like:\r\n-big y (including the parking lot)\r\n-dunkin donuts\r\n-starbucks\r\n-cvs\r\n-andrea's bakery\r\n-dynasty [chinese food]\r\n-library\r\n-the [ice cream shop]\r\n-general store\r\n\r\nMany hang [outs] for a wide range of teenagers include:\r\n-the center (big y and the stores surrounding it)\r\n-friend's houses\r\n-woods and streets\r\n-teen center (inside, outside)\r\n-football games\r\n-edmond town hall (inside, behind, in front)\r\n-cars\r\n-loews/amc theaters\r\n-local stores\r\n-danbury mall\r\n\r\nIt could be that in this town you will:\r\n-meet [the best friends] of your life\r\n-lose [the best friends] of your life\r\n-fall in and/or out of peer pressure\r\n-find someone that you love\r\n-lose someone that you love\r\n-witness some not great moments\r\n-witness some very great moments\r\n-laugh and cry\r\n-learn something (whether it's from school or not)\r\n-find out [what you are] passionate about\r\n-feel let down or like you have messed up\r\n-regain what you have lost\r\n-reach [self-discovery]",

The animal is unable to sleep [through the night] and its [sleeping pattern] is reversed from normal to that of a night shift worker. The canine can often be witnessed displaying the greatest levels of its daily energy quota after midnight, in the early hours of the morning, often seen leaping and prancing around the the yard, hunting, barking and guarding and/or bolting up and down the the fence line with great vigor. The animal will have more of a tendency towards delinquency including ignoring basic commands and destroying anything that it can get its teeth around during times of boredom. Contributing to the condition is the fact that the animal is forced to sleep during the day in direct or indirect sunlight which disturbs the [natural melatonin] cycle. The skills and motor patterns of these animals may become irregular and can often degrade to bizarre and down right frightening, the stuff from horror movies folks, as the animal slips further into the [vicious] cycle of NDS.",
