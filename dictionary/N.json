Sure, nerds could be gamers, but gaming is not usually a nerd's top priority. Nerds may find interest in their academics, find themselves to be highly hilarious, get excited over ridiculous or weird things, obsess over things, and memorize useless [information].This just names a few traits. Nerds are first class due to their ability to acheive more and have strange and unique minds.Finally, nerds love being nerds!!!\r\n\r\nSecond class\r\nGeek-a person that could possibly find themselves to be more into 'goofy' or strange things referring to things on [the internet], t.v., [video games], etc. Geeks are more likely to know more about pop culture or obsess over certain things like nerds would. Despite possible average academic grades, geeks are still not as smart as nerds making them a class lower than nerds.However, they are [on the brink] of succeeding on becoming  a nerd.\r\n\r\nFinal class\r\nDork-a person who may have the 'look' of a stereotipical nerd or geek, or some traits of the two. Dorks usually try to hide that they are qualified for the Nergeedor club. Dorks would be more likely to deny the fact that they are dorks at first. They could possibly be terrible at [video games] and are at a \"C\" average in academics. However, some dorks will work hard to upgrade into a geek or a nerd.Dorks also have the traits of a nerd or geek, but they don't show them proudly enough. This makes them the lowest ranking in the Nergeedor club. Being in the Nergeedor club is not a bad thing, you are just saying that you are either a nerd, geek, or a dork.\r\nThese descriptions do not name everything that a nerd, geek, or dork would consider themselves as.",

The buses feature a fully low-floor design, meaning that the floor is level with the curb, eliminating the need for stairs and making boarding easier for everyone, including passengers in wheelchairs, those with strollers, and the elderly.
