They don’t have any love for their victims it’s all about control because once they gain control over you they can use you to feed their grandiosity. They view people as objects that they need to give their false self attention (aka supply) so they can keep up their demonic facade. When they don’t get what they want they start devaluing and abusing their victims in order to keep their false sense of [superiority] in check.
