They don’t have any love for their victims it’s all about control because once they gain control over you they can use you to feed their grandiosity. They view people as objects that they need to give their false self attention (aka supply) so they can keep up their demonic facade. When they don’t get what they want they start devaluing and abusing their victims in order to keep their false sense of [superiority] in check.

Although Sandy Hook is classified as a separate town, it is commonly included in Newtown, seeing as people from both towns attend Newtown Middle School and Newtown High School.\r\n\r\nThe teenagers in Newtown range on and off from the popular cliche cliques.

The animal is unable to sleep [through the night] and its [sleeping pattern] is reversed from normal to that of a night shift worker. The canine can often be witnessed displaying the greatest levels of its daily energy quota after midnight, in the early hours of the morning, often seen leaping and prancing around the the yard, hunting, barking and guarding and/or bolting up and down the the fence line with great vigor. The animal will have more of a tendency towards delinquency including ignoring basic commands and destroying anything that it can get its teeth around during times of boredom. Contributing to the condition is the fact that the animal is forced to sleep during the day in direct or indirect sunlight which disturbs the [natural melatonin] cycle. The skills and motor patterns of these animals may become irregular and can often degrade to bizarre and down right frightening, the stuff from horror movies folks, as the animal slips further into the [vicious] cycle of NDS.",

Everyone thinks their rich because they haven’t met anyone but they all like in the inner Richmond or sunset. They don’t even know what a juul is or they think they’re going to die if they juul.
