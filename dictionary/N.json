The animal is unable to sleep [through the night] and its [sleeping pattern] is reversed from normal to that of a night shift worker. The canine can often be witnessed displaying the greatest levels of its daily energy quota after midnight, in the early hours of the morning, often seen leaping and prancing around the the yard, hunting, barking and guarding and/or bolting up and down the the fence line with great vigor. The animal will have more of a tendency towards delinquency including ignoring basic commands and destroying anything that it can get its teeth around during times of boredom. Contributing to the condition is the fact that the animal is forced to sleep during the day in direct or indirect sunlight which disturbs the [natural melatonin] cycle. The skills and motor patterns of these animals may become irregular and can often degrade to bizarre and down right frightening, the stuff from horror movies folks, as the animal slips further into the [vicious] cycle of NDS.",

Ninjas cut off heads ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so crazy and awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this ninja who was eating at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a spoon the ninja killed the whole town.  My friend Mark said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window. \r\n\r\nAnd that's what I call REAL [Ultimate Power]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \r\n\r\nIf you don't believe that ninjas have REAL [Ultimate Power] you better get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.   \r\n\r\nNinjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee).  \r\n\r\nQ and A: \r\n\r\nQ: Why is everyone so obsessed about ninjas?\r\n\r\nA: Ninjas are the [ultimate paradox]. On the one hand they don't give a crap, but on the other hand, ninjas are very careful and precise. \r\n\r\nQ: I heard that ninjas are always cruel or mean.  What's their problem?\r\n\r\nA: Whoever told you that is a total liar.  Just like other mammals, ninjas can be mean OR totally awesome.  \r\n\r\nQ: What do ninjas do when they're not cutting off heads or [flipping out]?\r\n\r\nA: Most of their free time is spent flying, but sometime they stab.

Niggahnauts send their scam e-mails and IMs from all over the globe, i.e., North Africa, [the Middle East], Pacific Asia, Brasil, the USA, Australia, the UK, etc.  However, by far, most niggahnauts reside in, and their scam messages and IMs originate from, West Africa, most notably Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nOne needs to be on the lookout for differentiated scams and evolving scamming techniques.  Some niggahnauts have noticed, for example, that westerners may not respond positively to IMs seemingly from an African female, so they switched her \"location\" to the USA, the UK or a country where large numbers of Africans or people of [African descent] may reside.  \r\n\r\nTo further improve their response rate, some niggahnauts decided to employ fake profiles of \"white\" women instead of say, African-Americans.  They [dropped the ball], of course, when in their fake Yahoo! profiles they named or nicknamed their bogus white female characters as \"Queen\" or a similar, African-sounding name.",
