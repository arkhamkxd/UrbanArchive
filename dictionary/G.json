There are those that call themselves \"goth\", but how are they worse than those who call themselves \"true\" goths? Why not just be yourself and to hell with the labels?\r\n\r\nThere is no point saying \"Most are teenage losers who need to validate themselves with fashion, but I, of course, am a true GOTH.\" It makes you sound just as arrogant and presumptuous.\r\n\r\nShop at Hot Topic, [Abercrombie and Fitch], Value Village, wherever, just...\r\n\r\nDon't bother categorizing everything, most especially fashion statements.",

Probably [one of the most] visually distinct subcultures around, characterized by a preference for dark clothing that is often influenced by Victorian, medieval and BDSM ascetics, among other things, and/or make-up, a pale complexion and some pretty [interesting] footwear.

Even basic SMS messaging-capable cell phones can be used as \"Gutenberries,\" however.\n\nAs of mid-2009, an emerging pattern is the use of mobile devices by Gutenberry activists and reformers to 1.) PUBLICIZE their causes internationally (using mobile interfaces to sites like Twitter and Facebook) and 2.) ORGANIZE and coordinate with other activists within their own country into demonstrations, flashmobs, etc. This is often quickly followed by blocking or shutting down of [social networking] services and/or cellular [communications] by the ruling governments in the countries in which Gutenberry Revolutions are taking place.\n\nThe term was inspired in part by a statement made by U.S. State Department official and Alec Ross at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York in June 2009, to the effect that every person with a text-capable mobile device possessed both means a producing content (like Gutenberg's printing press) ...and distributing it.\n\nSocial media analyst and Government 2.0 advocate Michael Russell then coined and and used the term \"Gutenberry\" in a blog post in July, 2009.\n\nGutenberry is a \"portmanteau\" or word mashup combining Gutenberg and Blackberry.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg (1398 – 1468) is credited as being the inventor of the printing press, and with introducing it and movable type to Europe. This made the mass-printing of books and literature possible, and the modern advances in [communications] that followed.\n\nBlackberry devices (produced by Research In Motion, Inc.) combine traditional wireless/cell phone voice [communications] with advanced messaging, web browsing and productivity functions previously found only in personal computers.",

He was [one of the most] successful military commanders in history, and was undefeated in battle. By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world known to the [ancient Greeks].\r\n\r\nFollowing the unification of the multiple city-states of [ancient Greece] under the rule of his father, Philip II of Macedon (a labour Alexander had to repeat because the southern Greeks rebelled after Philip's death), Alexander conquered the Achaemenid Persian Empire, including Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Gaza, Egypt, Bactria, and Mesopotamia, and extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as Punjab, India.\r\n\r\nPrior to his death, Alexander had already made plans for military and mercantile expansions into the Arabian peninsula, after which he was to turn his armies to the west (Carthage, Rome, and the Iberian Peninsula). His original vision had been to the east, though, to the ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea, as described by his boyhood tutor Aristotle.\r\n\r\nAlexander integrated many foreigners into his army, leading some scholars to credit him with a \"policy of fusion.\" He also encouraged marriages between his soldiers and foreigners; he himself went on to marry two foreign princesses.\r\n\r\nAlexander died after twelve years of constant military campaigning, possibly as a result of malaria, poisoning, typhoid fever, viral encephalitis or the [consequences] of alcoholism. His legacy and conquests lived on long after him, and ushered in centuries of Greek settlement and cultural influence over distant areas. This period is known as the Hellenistic Age, and featured a combination of Greek, Middle Eastern and Indian culture. Alexander himself was featured prominently in the history and myth of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appeared as a legendary hero in the tradition of Achilles.",

Its first capital was Osgiliath, moved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the capital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into the Fourth Age; other major fortresses [included] Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Osgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by [the brothers] Isildur and Anárion, exiles from Númenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king chieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor descended from Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies [possessed]. However, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a [devastating] plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded, and the former lands of Arnor were united with it under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.",

Although generally semiautomatic, the Glock 18 is manufactured for law inforcement and is capable of firing in full-automatic. A Glock has three safties, none are manual. [The hammer] is concealed within the slide, and is non-user accessable. The hammer is kept at half-cock. Glock handguns are criticized for their angled, ugly looks, occaisonally [uncomfortable] grips, and needlessly [complicated] safety mechanisms.

So because he is a sex slave to his father, he stays there and works.\r\n\r\nMyth: \"Goronchev actually had sex this one time\" This is also false. He is a ginger and they only reproduce by mitosis, not meiosis. So scientifically it's impossible if a woman were to say, be lured into his hive, he couldn't do much more than maybe show her his dildo.\r\n\r\nMyth: \"Goronchev is NOT a gay pedophile\" This one is also false. We have the pictures, videos, and eye witness testimonies to prove it. Click here to see it.\r\n\r\nMyth: \"Goronchev isn't sick\" The fact of the matter is that he is. He is suffering from leukemia and is slowly but surely losing his hair. Without his hat he looks like [Frankenstein]/That Bald Rapist in Prison. Though he said we cannot remove him from [the internets], his cancer will surely can.\r\n\r\nMyth: \"Goronchev has a dick\" This one is empirically untrue. Looking at his blog we see that he used a dildo to fake his penis length. Obviously, pics or it didn't happen.\r\n\r\nMyth: \"Goronchev cares about [black people]\" This is not true. Lets look at a few quotes from his pos youtube vids:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n“ \t \r\nA half ape, half human creature devolved from chimpanzees, who eats [fried chicken], watermelon, and collared greens, write songs about raping white woman and stealing welfare checks from grandmothers...Niggers are lazy, dumb, and worst of all smell after [taking a shower]...Jews are a subhuman species...Jews did [the World Trade Center] attacks...I have no penis\r\n  \t„\r\n \r\n\r\n—Smugfag\r\n\r\nSo goronchev smug fag troll.",
