      "definition": "1. \"Gaying up\" is one of those phrases that works on the various pejorative meanings of gay, in this instance to mean screwed up or not functioning correctly to some degree. This works forwards from the traditional belief that there is something inherently messed up about [homosexuality] and extends [the definition] of 'gay' accordingly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to gay something up is to ruin or corrupt it, especially through socially unpleasant or malicious behaviour, and for something to become 'gayed up' is for it to work to a less than satisfactory level, especially due to faulty wiring or some other internal defect.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is little homophobic intent in the use of these words.\r\n\r\n2. \"Gaying up\" can also be used as one of those phrases that works on the stereotypical aspects of gayness. If a club, or room, or 30-minute television show, is 'gayed up', it will undoubtedly have one of the following: flashing lights, colourful streamers, loud, bassy trance music, a disco ball, leather, bondage accessories, pastel colours, Liza Minelli, some camp bastard, mincing, open Hawaian shirts, YMCA by [The Village People] and various other things that a more politically-correct society might associate with [homosexuality] and sexual liberation in its friendlier stereotyping, and the kind of things [homosexuals] should probably try to distance themselves from.\r\n\r\nSimilar in definition to sexed up, in that it's made spicier, but gayed up is less likely to refer to lying in political documents to cajole a country to war. A 'gayed up' dossier would probably contain copious 'oohs' and 'doesn't that sound lovely?'",
      "example": "1. \"[Fucking Hell], why did you invite Ronan Keating to my party? He's sitting around singing stupid acoustic songs, drinking Strongbow straight from the bottle, and insisting we all watch Narnia. He's totally gayed the [whole thing] up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry I got cut off, your majesty, but my mobile 'phone is gaying up.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Join us for a gayed-up version of [David Letterman], tonight, where Letterman will wear shorts and the short guy with the band will be kitted out in a gimp costume. And it'll be very colourful too, and we'll probably change the theme-tune to something slightly demeaning towards gays.\"",
