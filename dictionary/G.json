      "definition": "1. \"Gaying up\" is one of those phrases that works on the various pejorative meanings of gay, in this instance to mean screwed up or not functioning correctly to some degree. This works forwards from the traditional belief that there is something inherently messed up about [homosexuality] and extends [the definition] of 'gay' accordingly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to gay something up is to ruin or corrupt it, especially through socially unpleasant or malicious behaviour, and for something to become 'gayed up' is for it to work to a less than satisfactory level, especially due to faulty wiring or some other internal defect.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is little homophobic intent in the use of these words.\r\n\r\n2. \"Gaying up\" can also be used as one of those phrases that works on the stereotypical aspects of gayness. If a club, or room, or 30-minute television show, is 'gayed up', it will undoubtedly have one of the following: flashing lights, colourful streamers, loud, bassy trance music, a disco ball, leather, bondage accessories, pastel colours, Liza Minelli, some camp bastard, mincing, open Hawaian shirts, YMCA by [The Village People] and various other things that a more politically-correct society might associate with [homosexuality] and sexual liberation in its friendlier stereotyping, and the kind of things [homosexuals] should probably try to distance themselves from.\r\n\r\nSimilar in definition to sexed up, in that it's made spicier, but gayed up is less likely to refer to lying in political documents to cajole a country to war. A 'gayed up' dossier would probably contain copious 'oohs' and 'doesn't that sound lovely?'",
      "example": "1. \"[Fucking Hell], why did you invite Ronan Keating to my party? He's sitting around singing stupid acoustic songs, drinking Strongbow straight from the bottle, and insisting we all watch Narnia. He's totally gayed the [whole thing] up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry I got cut off, your majesty, but my mobile 'phone is gaying up.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Join us for a gayed-up version of [David Letterman], tonight, where Letterman will wear shorts and the short guy with the band will be kitted out in a gimp costume. And it'll be very colourful too, and we'll probably change the theme-tune to something slightly demeaning towards gays.\"",

Ghetto chicks have a very limited [vocabulary], and attempt to [make up for it], by forming new words, such as \"[constipulated]\", or simply cursing [persistently], or using other types of vulgarities, and making noises, such as \"hmmg!\", or smacking their lips, and making other angry noises,grunts, and faces.  \r\n\r\n Many ghetto chicks drive a raggedy car, and play vulgar rap music very loudly, with the [windows rolled down], even on Sunday afternoons.  They also often have lots of kids, by lots of different men, one or more of which is serving time.  Usually a ghetto chick will also be on food stamps or welfare, and/or section eight, even when she has a man secretly living with her. Ghetto chicks also think it looks classy to get super long acrylic nails, with jewels and designs on them, sometimes even wearing their toenails the same way.  They often have their feet decorated, but forget to scrub off the dead, dry skin, thus making their feet look crusty. \r\n\r\nMost ghetto girls are very jealous and dramatic, and will fight at any time, for any small reason. Ghetto chicks HATE well-spoken, [intelligent], attractive, well-mannered women, and will often call them names, such as stuck-up bitches, snob, white girl, or Barbie. Ghetto chicks feel very threatened by classy, intelligent women.  Ghetto chicks are often aggressive, have no manners, and no home training.  They will often steal, and commit violent acts as well.  You should not threaten, or offend, or even look a ghetto chick directly in the eyes, unless you know you can defend yourself in a fight, possibly even involving a weapon. Ghetto chicks should be avoided at all times, if at all possible.

Homosexual females are commonly called lesbians.\n\nIII. The original [definition of gay] was 'carefree', 'happy' or 'bright and showy'. It came from the Old French word gai, and arrived in English during the 12th century.\n\nIV. These days 'gay' is, wrongly, used to refer to something (namely an [inanimate object], for example a bag) that is unfavourable. Synonyms of this sort include 'sad' and 'lame'. They are all wrong, because an inanimatr object, such as a bag, presumably do not have feelings (sorry, bags, if you do) and therefore they cannot be sad, and this is a ridiculously derived insult. Bags do not have legs either, and thus they cannot be lame. But the supposed 'insult' of 'gay' annoys me most. Firstly because an [inanimate object], such as a bag, cannot really be attracted to other things of the same sex. According to humans, as we made them, they do not have genders of their own.\n\nOffensive, rude, and not-to-be-used 'synonyms' include faggot, fag and [queer], the latter not being as bad and commonly used by gays themselves - but there are many more worse ones. For lesbians there is dyke, lez and lezzer, but there are probably far worse for these too.\n\nA woman or girl who has many gay male friends is sometimes known as a fag hag.\n\nGay is not an insult.\n\nI love gay people.",

I for one have seen one of them, It's color is similar to the \"[pink panther]\", yet the giant burnso is normally \"green\" with anger resembling a giant wasabi pea. The myth of the giant burnso was originated from early 1400's, where a seafarer traveling to seek land first came across the giant burnso. After the capsized vessel was found floating on shore, the sea man was found in the boat truly scared to death, his eyes wide open, only no words were ever to be spoken from him again. On a note they found the words \"it was the giant burnso\". After days passed he finally spoke of his tragic meeting with this creature, his voice shaky he described that once he looked into the cold eyes of the burnso, he went numb. He heard a horrific screeching come from the beast, all he could make out from the screams was the words \"burnso, giant burnso\". Finally the creature picked up the man, and the way he described it was he felt like the creature was actually sucking the life from his mouth. His body than went limp, and the creature disappeared. Other stories have been similar to that of the sea mans tragic meeting, only the others all describe the colors of the burnso as [everything but] pink, some say a [yellow tail], with a gian [brown beard], while others only say they saw green.

He is a part of the [Republican party], which has, recently, lost its majority hold over both the House of Representatives and Senate - both houses of Congress. \r\n\r\nHis achievements are, as follows:\r\n- Worsening our debt, causing our balls to be more and more in the Chinese vice grip;\r\n- Entering us into a war for murky reasons, and not being willing to either do what it takes to eliminate the insurgency, or leave;\r\n- Nothing regarding outsourcing or illegal immigration;\r\n- Making the US look like a bunch of idiots (possibly rightfully so) on the world stage;\r\n- Butchering foreign affairs, and setting the NATO alliance on the brink of collapse;\r\n- Wishing to ban abortions, homosexual unions, etc.;\r\n- Et fucking cetera.",
