Upon settling in areas around the Black Sea, they encountered the Roman Empire, and in the fourth century AD, sacked the city, putting the nail [in the coffin] for the mighty empire, and that was the end of that.\r\n\r\n2. Short for 'gothic,' a musical and stylistic movement that came off the punk scene in the late 1970s with such bands as Bauhaus and Siouxsie and the Banshees.  Popularity has waxed and waned since but the movement has remained intact to this day.  Probably [one of the most] visually distinct subcultures around, characterized by a preference for dark clothing that is often influenced by Victorian, medieval and BDSM ascetics, among other things, and/or make-up, a pale complexion and some pretty [interesting] footwear.  Since events like Columbine that sparked a witch hunt, goth culture has been accused of corrupting minors with Satanism, vampirism and violence.  In truth, a great number of goths are actually [intelligent], articulate and conscious people who, despite the foreboding appearance, are [for the most part], more stimulating to be around than any of the varieties of chickenshit conformist that dominate the world today.\r\n\r\n3. An angsty, angry suburban teenager who needs a great way to rebel against his or her unfair parents.  What better way than with a Marilyn Manson t-shirt, a terrible black hair dye job and matching lipstick?  Claiming to be 'gothic' because they listen to angry nu-metal bands like Slipknot and Korn, they often think their issues like drugs and self-mutilation contribute to their gawthick-ness.  They will probably grow out of it in a few months and find something new to piss of their parents with.  Until then, they'll just give the rest of us a bad name.",

Even basic SMS messaging-capable cell phones can be used as \"Gutenberries,\" however.\n\nAs of mid-2009, an emerging pattern is the use of mobile devices by Gutenberry activists and reformers to 1.) PUBLICIZE their causes internationally (using mobile interfaces to sites like Twitter and Facebook) and 2.) ORGANIZE and coordinate with other activists within their own country into demonstrations, flashmobs, etc. This is often quickly followed by blocking or shutting down of [social networking] services and/or cellular [communications] by the ruling governments in the countries in which Gutenberry Revolutions are taking place.\n\nThe term was inspired in part by a statement made by U.S. State Department official and Alec Ross at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York in June 2009, to the effect that every person with a text-capable mobile device possessed both means a producing content (like Gutenberg's printing press) ...and distributing it.\n\nSocial media analyst and Government 2.0 advocate Michael Russell then coined and and used the term \"Gutenberry\" in a blog post in July, 2009.\n\nGutenberry is a \"portmanteau\" or word mashup combining Gutenberg and Blackberry.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg (1398 – 1468) is credited as being the inventor of the printing press, and with introducing it and movable type to Europe. This made the mass-printing of books and literature possible, and the modern advances in [communications] that followed.\n\nBlackberry devices (produced by Research In Motion, Inc.) combine traditional wireless/cell phone voice [communications] with advanced messaging, web browsing and productivity functions previously found only in personal computers.",

By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world known to the [ancient Greeks].\r\n\r\nFollowing the unification of the multiple city-states of [ancient Greece] under the rule of his father, Philip II of Macedon (a labour Alexander had to repeat because the southern Greeks rebelled after Philip's death), Alexander conquered the Achaemenid Persian Empire, including Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Gaza, Egypt, Bactria, and Mesopotamia, and extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as Punjab, India.\r\n\r\nPrior to his death, Alexander had already made plans for military and mercantile expansions into the Arabian peninsula, after which he was to turn his armies to the west (Carthage, Rome, and the Iberian Peninsula). His original vision had been to the east, though, to the ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea, as described by his boyhood tutor Aristotle.\r\n\r\nAlexander integrated many foreigners into his army, leading some scholars to credit him with a \"policy of fusion.\" He also encouraged marriages between his soldiers and foreigners; he himself went on to marry two foreign princesses.\r\n\r\nAlexander died after twelve years of constant military campaigning, possibly as a result of malaria, poisoning, typhoid fever, viral encephalitis or the [consequences] of alcoholism. His legacy and conquests lived on long after him, and ushered in centuries of Greek settlement and cultural influence over distant areas. This period is known as the Hellenistic Age, and featured a combination of Greek, Middle Eastern and Indian culture. Alexander himself was featured prominently in the history and myth of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appeared as a legendary hero in the tradition of Achilles.",
