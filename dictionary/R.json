When pushed to their limits, they can transform into a whirlwind of rage and unleash a [surprisingly] mighty wallop. It's like watching a peaceful picnic turn into a chaotic food fight at the snap of a finger. However, this turbulent storm of emotions soon dissipates, leaving the Rumblephant bewildered and teary-eyed, seeking solace in the comforting embrace of their pillow. In the morning, they rise [with the sun], their memory reset like a sleepy computer, until a chance encounter or a mere whiff of remembrance awakens the dormant anger. At this point, the Rumblephant finds themselves in a sticky predicament, [simultaneously] frustrated with both the external cause of their anger and their own forgetfulness. It's like a comedy of errors, where the protagonist unwittingly becomes the antagonist in their own story.
