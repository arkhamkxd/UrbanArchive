Roblox created the catalog to make people pay real life money to look as roblox calls it, \"More Cool Looking\", and if you didn't pay real life money, players would often call you \"Noob\" because you have no items also known as, (Hats, Gear, Shirts, Faces, Packages, etc.). Roblox's community has become really, dumb or retarded.\r\nThe word \"Noob\" is really used against you if you have no items or you've just joined the roblox site.\r\nRoblox also has the worlds dumbest BAN system, i once was banned for 3 days because i said \"[Give me the money] over paypal!\" As a joke to one of my friends, and some robloxian decided to report it. Tix was a good way for people who didn't want to spent real life money on ROBLOX.

The [circumstances] of this [unfortunate] incident are shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, but one of the results of the event was the return to the poet - at his own request - of the poetry volume which had already been presented to Riddell; the second had neither been completed nor sent.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated May 1794, to Riddell's sister in which Burns requests the return of the poetry volume, he refers to its contents as 'a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written ... some of them puerile and silly ...'. This is somewhat insincere and in reality Burns was highly aware of the value of his poems, but it shows his keenness to have returned to him a volume he knew to contain a great compilation of some of his best work.

The practice of religion is a fundamentally human activity, leading scholars to questions why this should be so. One of the founders of anthropology, Sir Edward B. Tylor argued that religion [originated] in animism, (from anima, “spirit”) from the experiences of ancient peoples in death and dreams. Then, Sir James Frazer collected a massive amount of data from ancient and indigenous cultures and argued that religion [originated] in magic. Later, Sigmund Freud argued from psychoanalysis that God is a projection of a father-figure growing out of the human need to feel secure and the feelings of love-hate-fear we feel. Karl Marx argued it exists as a means of social control and pacification.",

      "definition": "Ragic is an uncommon man of supreme style. He does what he wants, when he wants, where he wants. You won't find him on facebook, myspace, msn et cetera because he is probably out being cool somewhere. He might be on a motorcycle, but it's probably not a Harley or a crotch rocket because he won't spend that much money to be accepted. Traditionally, he will smoke, but it's not necessary at all. He feels no obligation whatsoever to justify his beliefs, values, convictions, morals et cetera with anyone. He likes his music because it sounds cool to him. You won't find him if you look for him because there is no sure way to identify him. One does not think that he is badass; he KNOWS it and that's that. Alternatively, a badass is the complete opposite of a douchebag.\r\n\r\nLikely to be found in a popular pub taking your money on the pool table then buying you a beer with it, you won't identify him by his clothing because there is no badass uniform. He's probably not sporting the latest fad, he's not wearing $[200] jeans, and he doesn't have [frosted hair]. He's always up for a challenge, he'll probably succeed and he seems to be good at everything. But at the same time, the badass attitude is like: \"ok well [I don't give a shit]\".\r\n\r\nGenuinely intriguing and intrigued by others, he radiates confidence in everything he does and fears nobody. He won't pick a fight but DO NOT fuck with him, because he will [beat the shit out of] you with his bare hands. He's taken more punches to the face than you have, and he's probably busted a few knuckles (on more than just the [kitchen cabinets] in the dark). Treats people with respect up to the point where they cross the line with him. Keeps his cool but won't be pushed around. He does not justify [insecurities] by bringing others down; he'll accept everyone to have as much fun as he is having regardless of what they look like;Badass;Rage-tastic",

There are currently four locations for the franchise at the time of writing: they are Gatlinburg, TN; Myrtle Beach, SC; San Antonio, TX; and Pattaya, Thailand.\r\n\r\nThe interior (and exterior) of each Haunted Adventure differs, but they all follow the same basic theme: the [haunted house] was once a casket-making company, owned by two ominous individuals known only as Grimsby and Streaper (hint: see if you can spot anything familiar in their names). While they remained in charge of the company, strange happenings would occur: people and pets would go missing, strange smells would emanate from the building, and strange noises would be heard at night. After several years, the original owners of the company mysteriously disappeared, and the company was abandoned. Another several years passed, and then the old company was discovered by Ripley [Entertainment], who purchased it. Pending a decision on how to further develop the property, Ripley [Entertainment] is now leading \"tours\" of the company- but they are quick to warn that they will not be [responsible] for any disappearances or loss of sanity!\r\n\r\nThe Gatlinburg location was the first to open, in 1999. It was followed by the Myrtle Beach location, then San Antonio. The Pattaya location is the newest to date (October 2004). Most of them are open year-round. Visitors to the attractions can find them easily recognizable by the presence of a monster named \"Stumpy\", who sits in a box outside. He named for the fact that all this ghoul has is a torso... he is missing [everything but] some spine and a pelvis below it!\r\n\r\nIt is noted that the Haunted Adventure attractions are very dark, and can get very intense. Many special effects are involved, including strobe lights and [animatronics]. There are also a number of live actors involved, who will most certainly do their best to get a scare out of you. The attractions are not recommended for children under 6-8 years old, and any child between the ages of 6 or 8 to 11 years old must be accompanied by an adult (the age limit varies with the location). Depending on the attraction, it can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to tour it. Prices will vary.\r\n\r\nThe Haunted Adventure locations do have one special event each year: their October \"Fright Nights\" shows. Generally held every Friday and Saturday (and sometimes Sundays) night in October, the [haunted house] is stocked with many more actors on those nights, and the attraction itself is revamped to fit the year's \"theme\". For example, past themes at the Gatlinburg location have included \"Carnival\" and \"Scary Tales\" (a spin-off of \"Fairy Tales\").",

The remote acts as a freehand pointer and can be held like a [baseball bat], gun, drumstick, etc; This along with the analog stick supposedly is equal to if not better than a keyboard/mouse combo (most helpful in FPS games), hence its 'revolutionary' tag. It also offers free wi-fi online play, the ability to download games from Nintendo's extensive library, gamecube backward-compatability, and dvd player functions.\r\n\r\n The other 'revolutionary' aspect of this system is that its headed in a totally different direction than its [competition], Sony's [PlayStation 3] and Microsoft's Xbox 360. Where as the aforementioned are geared to be high-end media powerhouses with many features, the Nintendo is striving for improving the quality and 'fun' of [playing the game]; this can turn out wonderful or utterly crappy, depending on [the general] public's acceptance of the new controller and the ability of 3rd Party [developers] to make full use of its capabilities.\r\n\r\nPS3/360: Traditional approach, focusing on better, stunning graphics and sound as well as extra media features such as MP3 playing. Critics argue that a game with crappy gameplay that looks beautiful just makes it beautiful crap; also, the more of a [powerhouse] a console is, the more expensive it is to develop for.\r\n\r\nRevolution: Radical approach, focusing on the gameplay. The controller should be easy to use by anyone, but above all fun to play with. Critics say that the Revolution will not be able to run games with graphics within this generation's standards. It is also thought that the controller will make you tired after swinging it around so much.\r\n\r\n Its name is slated to change before release, sometime after Q2 2006.",

It was considered a major containment breach by the Australian Federal Police, and as a result, 3 decontamination units were dispatched to the location in order to contain said incident. That is when things turned violent.\n\nThe young boy morphed into a sort of being, and proceeded to attack the 3 decontamination units of 4 men, killing 12 people marking [one] of the greatest catastrophes in AFP history. Fast forward to 5 months later, 3 [independent] researchers noticed a bookmark in this boy's tabs, and when questioned about them, the young boy self imploded and as a result, tumbled into a depressive state before being purified by the might of these brave 3 researchers.\n\nNow, the young boy lives with the [Post Traumatic Stress] of his ejaculation addiction to anime girl of 2hou, Remilia Scarlet. He is outcasted amongst members of his society, and because of the 12 AFP Officers he gruesomely murdered, he will serve multiple life sentences in the near future.",
