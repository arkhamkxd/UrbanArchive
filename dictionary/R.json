That's also true in any formal radio telephone procedure such as in police RT where they're not used together. In aviation use neither roger nor wilco are even used much as [individual] words. The full meaning of roger is 'Your last message is received and understood' and it's origin indeed as stated by schizzy is the original phonetic alphabet use of roger for the letter 'R' to 1951now romeo . The full meaning of 'wilco' is 'Your last message is received and [understood] AND wilL BE coMPLIED WITH'. Therefore wilco already includes roger.\n\nHowever, this being [Urban Dictionary] it's the slang/colloquial use being defined so in that setting schizzy's example of the wife/husband is correct whether speaking directly or by phone. It'd also be very acceptable if they were using CB radio I guess. It's slang use can even have slightly sarcastic or facetious overtones at times. However, having an aviation background I reject his example of the pilot and ATC. Redundancy is the lesser sin, no pilot should answer like that. It's required to repeat the instruction back to the controller. The instruction wouldn't be given verbatim as quoted anyway. In aviation, the use of roger to acknowledge [information] no [instructions] may be acceptable at times but wilco is rarely used if at all. Mostly where roger could be used it's sufficient to simply answer with the aircraft's call sign.",
