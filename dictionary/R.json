This includes a throbbing, repetitive rhythm, or “beat” - which is equivalent to the motion of a hand running up and down the length of a male’s phallus - while [simultaneously] listening to some horny [high school dropout] rhyming and rambling off about his desire to “knock boots” with the listener, while concurrently threatening to “[bust a cap in your ass]” if the audience member refuses to respect his “slim shady.”  To listen to rap music is essentially to be raped in the ear.",
