The [circumstances] of this [unfortunate] incident are shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, but one of the results of the event was the return to the poet - at his own request - of the poetry volume which had already been presented to Riddell; the second had neither been completed nor sent.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated May 1794, to Riddell's sister in which Burns requests the return of the poetry volume, he refers to its contents as 'a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written ... some of them puerile and silly ...'. This is somewhat insincere and in reality Burns was highly aware of the value of his poems, but it shows his keenness to have returned to him a volume he knew to contain a great compilation of some of his best work.

The practice of religion is a fundamentally human activity, leading scholars to questions why this should be so. One of the founders of anthropology, Sir Edward B. Tylor argued that religion [originated] in animism, (from anima, “spirit”) from the experiences of ancient peoples in death and dreams. Then, Sir James Frazer collected a massive amount of data from ancient and indigenous cultures and argued that religion [originated] in magic. Later, Sigmund Freud argued from psychoanalysis that God is a projection of a father-figure growing out of the human need to feel secure and the feelings of love-hate-fear we feel. Karl Marx argued it exists as a means of social control and pacification.",

Having relatively low power, this is a bad situation made worse due to the enemies' power which can possibly kill in one action. Combined with the enemy AI usually targeting weaker characters, starting players often lose the battle after taking one or even no action due to the high speed of the enemies. Fortunately, proper pre-battle planning can negate this hindrance.\r\n\r\nAn FFT remake exists on the PSP, and the AI on \"Protect X\" scenarios supposedly retreats instead of engaging the enemy.",

He won't pick a fight but DO NOT fuck with him, because he will [beat the shit out of] you with his bare hands. He's taken more punches to the face than you have, and he's probably busted a few knuckles (on more than just the [kitchen cabinets] in the dark).

There are currently four locations for the franchise at the time of writing: they are Gatlinburg, TN; Myrtle Beach, SC; San Antonio, TX; and Pattaya, Thailand.\r\n\r\nThe interior (and exterior) of each Haunted Adventure differs, but they all follow the same basic theme: the [haunted house] was once a casket-making company, owned by two ominous individuals known only as Grimsby and Streaper (hint: see if you can spot anything familiar in their names). While they remained in charge of the company, strange happenings would occur: people and pets would go missing, strange smells would emanate from the building, and strange noises would be heard at night. After several years, the original owners of the company mysteriously disappeared, and the company was abandoned. Another several years passed, and then the old company was discovered by Ripley [Entertainment], who purchased it. Pending a decision on how to further develop the property, Ripley [Entertainment] is now leading \"tours\" of the company- but they are quick to warn that they will not be [responsible] for any disappearances or loss of sanity!\r\n\r\nThe Gatlinburg location was the first to open, in 1999. It was followed by the Myrtle Beach location, then San Antonio. The Pattaya location is the newest to date (October 2004). Most of them are open year-round. Visitors to the attractions can find them easily recognizable by the presence of a monster named \"Stumpy\", who sits in a box outside. He named for the fact that all this ghoul has is a torso... he is missing [everything but] some spine and a pelvis below it!\r\n\r\nIt is noted that the Haunted Adventure attractions are very dark, and can get very intense. Many special effects are involved, including strobe lights and [animatronics]. There are also a number of live actors involved, who will most certainly do their best to get a scare out of you. The attractions are not recommended for children under 6-8 years old, and any child between the ages of 6 or 8 to 11 years old must be accompanied by an adult (the age limit varies with the location). Depending on the attraction, it can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to tour it. Prices will vary.\r\n\r\nThe Haunted Adventure locations do have one special event each year: their October \"Fright Nights\" shows. Generally held every Friday and Saturday (and sometimes Sundays) night in October, the [haunted house] is stocked with many more actors on those nights, and the attraction itself is revamped to fit the year's \"theme\". For example, past themes at the Gatlinburg location have included \"Carnival\" and \"Scary Tales\" (a spin-off of \"Fairy Tales\").",
