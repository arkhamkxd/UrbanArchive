It's like watching a peaceful picnic turn into a chaotic food fight at the snap of a finger. However, this turbulent storm of emotions soon dissipates, leaving the Rumblephant bewildered and teary-eyed, seeking solace in the comforting embrace of their pillow. In the morning, they rise [with the sun], their memory reset like a sleepy computer, until a chance encounter or a mere whiff of remembrance awakens the dormant anger. At this point, the Rumblephant finds themselves in a sticky predicament, [simultaneously] frustrated with both the external cause of their anger and their own forgetfulness. It's like a comedy of errors, where the protagonist unwittingly becomes the antagonist in their own story.

This is somewhat insincere and in reality Burns was highly aware of the value of his poems, but it shows his keenness to have returned to him a volume he knew to contain a great compilation of some of his best work.

The practice of religion is a fundamentally human activity, leading scholars to questions why this should be so. One of the founders of anthropology, Sir Edward B. Tylor argued that religion [originated] in animism, (from anima, “spirit”) from the experiences of ancient peoples in death and dreams. Then, Sir James Frazer collected a massive amount of data from ancient and indigenous cultures and argued that religion [originated] in magic. Later, Sigmund Freud argued from psychoanalysis that God is a projection of a father-figure growing out of the human need to feel secure and the feelings of love-hate-fear we feel. Karl Marx argued it exists as a means of social control and pacification.",

He is also often referred to as 'Richardo Madjokovic', in comparison to the World [Number 1] Novak Djokovic, however this is often viewed as an injustice to his tennis playing abilities. Richard was also raised [in the hood] and regularly slanged dope. He lives the thug life to this day and constantly fucks bitches and makes money. His favourite rap artist of all time is Tupac, who is 99.99% likely to be his father after DNA tests were conducted by [Stephen Hawking] in 2010. According to many close friends and family, Richard has inherited his father's rapping talents and is predicted to unleash his unique skills onto the American hip-hop scene within weeks. There is much speculation that his debut album will be titled 'His eyez on me' as a testimony to his father's life and career. There have been reports that Mad Dog has been dating [Victoria's Secret] models, Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima, at the same time. He is also believed to have fathered [Kanye West] and Kim Kardashian's child, North-West, although he claims he had no say in the naming of the child.",
