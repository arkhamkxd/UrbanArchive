Slant eyed rice enthusiasts would [take the hint], and install gigantic fart cans to their tailpipes to turn their tranquil hum of their civics into a vomit-inducing whine.

Catalytic converters reduce [performance] and sound just as much as mufflers, though if overworked (if your car has rich-fuel problems), it would glow and strain, melting the honeycomb like structures inside, further clogging the path in which exhaust can escape.\r\n\r\nA obstructed path for exhaust gases to escape is very bad for engine [performance], if nearly completed plugged, exhaust gases have nowhere to go but back into the combustion chamber, causing the motor to run terribly, or stall.\r\n\r\nThe idea of running your car, preferably a hot rod open header, is to increase [performance], lessen the strain on the engine, make it sound louder and more macho, as well as to impress your friends. \r\n\r\nUnless your attending a open header contest with other like gearheads, removing any of the above components is ILLEGAL as stated by the DMV.
