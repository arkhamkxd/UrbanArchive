Created by Dai Nagao, Do As Infinity (also known as DAI or Do As)consists of the typical types of members Rock bands are made of, such as a drummer, guitarists, a bassist, and a lead singer. The main focus of the band was it's lead singer (Tomiko Van), it's guitarist (Ryo Owatari), and it's composer (Dai Nagao), although there are other members. What sets Do As Infinity apart is their sound.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity is rooted in Rock, both old and new. Their featured guitarist, Ryo Owatari, is a skilled musician who is best known for his extremely accurate and powerful [manipulation] of his instrument, and his very Led Zeppelin/Jimi Hendrix-era guitar style. Their mix of both Rock sounds and vocals and Pop sounds and vocals helps their music have an infinite number of [possibilities].\r\n\r\nThe lead singer of the band is Tomiko Van, a vocalist whose range covers both Pop and Rock-she is best known for her soft vocals, her powerful soaring vocals, and everything in between. Stunningly gorgeous and incredibly down-to-Earth, Tomiko has helped Do As Infinity rise to the top, and has helped the band become one of the mainstays in the Japanese music industry.\r\n\r\nDai Nagao, the man who brought the band together, is the band's composer and one of the guitarists. After composing some songs for Japanese Pop stars Ayumi Hamasaki and Hitomi, Dai was given the oppurtunity to create a band of his own. Do As Infinity was created (basically, Dai created DAI). After composing the album Break of Dawn, which was among the top 10 selling albums of it's time, New World put Do As Infinity on top of the charts. Dai [eventually] stopped appearing live and in music videos with the band, so that he could focus on composing for them [behind the scenes]. He eventually created his own record label.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity was created in 1999, and very [unfortunately] (and a shock to all of their fans), they split up in [2005]. [September 29], 1999 to [September 29], 2005. They remain one of [the greatest] Pop/Rock groups of all time, Japanese or not.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity may not be around anymore, but Tomiko Van is continuing her career as a solo artist, and Ryo Owatari is dedicating himself full-time to a side project he worked on during their last year together (the he works with now is Missile Innovation, under the Tearbridge Records label). Dai Nagao will continue to compose for Avex Trax and his own record label.",

Too clarify, seriously Filipinos are NOTHING like that one kids definition.\r\n\r\nLiving with a house full of them, here's my opinion. \r\n\r\n1.)Filipinos are NOT lazy. They work harder being in a 3 world country, than any of us fat ass Americans. : And they only reason that kid thinks it takes too long to get anything done is simply they probably just don't want to work with them.\r\n\r\n2.)Filipinos don't think ALL foreigners are rich, just Americans. But then again in a 3rd world country, who doesn't think that?!\r\n\r\n3.)Their language isn't annoying. English is annoying. Come on people it's everywhere! Tagalog is just a harsher language but hey, there's nothing like it.\r\n\r\n4.)Filipino women are not desperate to marry foreigners. Those my friends are a little something we call \"gold diggers.\" Every country has 'em. \r\n\r\n5.)Okay, I have to admit, they're pretty prideful. They kind of do think they're better than a lot of other countries. \r\n\r\n6.)They're not kids. They just want to have fun. Here in America we work till we die, there motto is somewhat like the \"Live free die young\" saying. Sorry he has to be too stuck-up to appreciate some real fun.\r\n\r\n7.)Their UP is just one if the things they seem to show off more, it's not a big deal, get that stick out of your ass.\r\n\r\n8.)[How are you going] to put THEY ARE SHORT.\r\n\r\nOf course they are, they're Asian you [ignorant pig].\r\n\r\n9.)They are noisy? No. Like I said earlier, their language is just harsher.\r\n\r\n10.)Filipinos, like you just put a few points ago, are too proud. So how can you put that they're wanna-be Americans? They're too proud. And the only reason they want their kids in the States, is because America is a land of [opportunity], \r\n\r\n11.)Once again, you [ignorant pig], English is widely spoken and has been for awhile. If you took your head out of your ass you would know that almost every language uses a few English words now and then.\r\n\r\n12.)[I don't really care] what [you say] about their diet.\r\n\r\n13.)The rest is basically gibberish. You are a [racist bastard] whose words only mean as much on the internet.",

The second Doink, also evil, was played by Steve Keirn, best known for his work in Florida and Memphis with Stan Lane as the Fabulous Ones during the 1980s. These Doinks feuded with Crush (formerly of Demolition; real name Bryan Adams, most recently of the team Kronik).  Doink started getting bigger face (good guy) reactions from the crowd and was turned face.  Steve Lombardi, best known as the [Brooklyn Brawler], took over the gimmick for a short time, until Gary Fall, aka Ray Apollo or Ray Licaccelli, took over the gimmick full-time.  Doink turning face is generally considered to be the moment when the Doink gimmick lost its edge and its coolness.  The addition of his midget sidekick Dink didn't help matters.   The good Doink feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow, who [deserved better].  Other wrestlers who have donned the Doink disguise at one point or another are Jeff Jarrett, Shane Douglas, Dusty Wolfe, the Bushwhackers, Men [on a Mission] and Midwest indy workers Terek the Great and Truth Martini.",
