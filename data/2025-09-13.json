Created by Dai Nagao, Do As Infinity (also known as DAI or Do As)consists of the typical types of members Rock bands are made of, such as a drummer, guitarists, a bassist, and a lead singer. The main focus of the band was it's lead singer (Tomiko Van), it's guitarist (Ryo Owatari), and it's composer (Dai Nagao), although there are other members. What sets Do As Infinity apart is their sound.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity is rooted in Rock, both old and new. Their featured guitarist, Ryo Owatari, is a skilled musician who is best known for his extremely accurate and powerful [manipulation] of his instrument, and his very Led Zeppelin/Jimi Hendrix-era guitar style. Their mix of both Rock sounds and vocals and Pop sounds and vocals helps their music have an infinite number of [possibilities].\r\n\r\nThe lead singer of the band is Tomiko Van, a vocalist whose range covers both Pop and Rock-she is best known for her soft vocals, her powerful soaring vocals, and everything in between. Stunningly gorgeous and incredibly down-to-Earth, Tomiko has helped Do As Infinity rise to the top, and has helped the band become one of the mainstays in the Japanese music industry.\r\n\r\nDai Nagao, the man who brought the band together, is the band's composer and one of the guitarists. After composing some songs for Japanese Pop stars Ayumi Hamasaki and Hitomi, Dai was given the oppurtunity to create a band of his own. Do As Infinity was created (basically, Dai created DAI). After composing the album Break of Dawn, which was among the top 10 selling albums of it's time, New World put Do As Infinity on top of the charts. Dai [eventually] stopped appearing live and in music videos with the band, so that he could focus on composing for them [behind the scenes]. He eventually created his own record label.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity was created in 1999, and very [unfortunately] (and a shock to all of their fans), they split up in [2005]. [September 29], 1999 to [September 29], 2005. They remain one of [the greatest] Pop/Rock groups of all time, Japanese or not.\r\n\r\nDo As Infinity may not be around anymore, but Tomiko Van is continuing her career as a solo artist, and Ryo Owatari is dedicating himself full-time to a side project he worked on during their last year together (the he works with now is Missile Innovation, under the Tearbridge Records label). Dai Nagao will continue to compose for Avex Trax and his own record label.",

Too clarify, seriously Filipinos are NOTHING like that one kids definition.\r\n\r\nLiving with a house full of them, here's my opinion. \r\n\r\n1.)Filipinos are NOT lazy. They work harder being in a 3 world country, than any of us fat ass Americans. : And they only reason that kid thinks it takes too long to get anything done is simply they probably just don't want to work with them.\r\n\r\n2.)Filipinos don't think ALL foreigners are rich, just Americans. But then again in a 3rd world country, who doesn't think that?!\r\n\r\n3.)Their language isn't annoying. English is annoying. Come on people it's everywhere! Tagalog is just a harsher language but hey, there's nothing like it.\r\n\r\n4.)Filipino women are not desperate to marry foreigners. Those my friends are a little something we call \"gold diggers.\" Every country has 'em. \r\n\r\n5.)Okay, I have to admit, they're pretty prideful. They kind of do think they're better than a lot of other countries. \r\n\r\n6.)They're not kids. They just want to have fun. Here in America we work till we die, there motto is somewhat like the \"Live free die young\" saying. Sorry he has to be too stuck-up to appreciate some real fun.\r\n\r\n7.)Their UP is just one if the things they seem to show off more, it's not a big deal, get that stick out of your ass.\r\n\r\n8.)[How are you going] to put THEY ARE SHORT.\r\n\r\nOf course they are, they're Asian you [ignorant pig].\r\n\r\n9.)They are noisy? No. Like I said earlier, their language is just harsher.\r\n\r\n10.)Filipinos, like you just put a few points ago, are too proud. So how can you put that they're wanna-be Americans? They're too proud. And the only reason they want their kids in the States, is because America is a land of [opportunity], \r\n\r\n11.)Once again, you [ignorant pig], English is widely spoken and has been for awhile. If you took your head out of your ass you would know that almost every language uses a few English words now and then.\r\n\r\n12.)[I don't really care] what [you say] about their diet.\r\n\r\n13.)The rest is basically gibberish. You are a [racist bastard] whose words only mean as much on the internet.",

The second Doink, also evil, was played by Steve Keirn, best known for his work in Florida and Memphis with Stan Lane as the Fabulous Ones during the 1980s. These Doinks feuded with Crush (formerly of Demolition; real name Bryan Adams, most recently of the team Kronik).  Doink started getting bigger face (good guy) reactions from the crowd and was turned face.  Steve Lombardi, best known as the [Brooklyn Brawler], took over the gimmick for a short time, until Gary Fall, aka Ray Apollo or Ray Licaccelli, took over the gimmick full-time.  Doink turning face is generally considered to be the moment when the Doink gimmick lost its edge and its coolness.  The addition of his midget sidekick Dink didn't help matters.   The good Doink feuded with Bam Bam Bigelow, who [deserved better].  Other wrestlers who have donned the Doink disguise at one point or another are Jeff Jarrett, Shane Douglas, Dusty Wolfe, the Bushwhackers, Men [on a Mission] and Midwest indy workers Terek the Great and Truth Martini.",

Any [ingredients] can be used for the sauces, but tempoyak (durian) is the most popular among Bruneians.\n\nWhen you eat ambuyat, you must use traditional chopsticks called candas. You have to put candas into ambuyat, pull it out and roll it. This is a bit difficult, so many people fail at this stage. However, if you've successfully done, put it into a sauce and you can eat.\n\nAmbuyat can be said an equivalent to rice and [noodle]. It is also eaten with [side dishes], such as fish and [vegetables]. Sometimes, it is fried with eggs and soy sauces and became ambuyat goreng.\n\nAmbuyat is also known as linut in Malaysia and papeda in Indonesia.",
    "example": "Here's how to cook and eat ambuyat. First, you must prepare ambulong and mix with room [temperature] water. Once it has a milk-like texture, pour some boiled water and mix until it becomes as sticky as mochi. Now, ambuyat is done. You must use candas to roll and dip into a tempoyak sauce to eat, but a spoon can also be used [if you don't] have candas or have an issue for using it. You may also fry with eggs and soy sauces to make ambuyat goreng, [something] like nasi goreng or mi goreng.",

    "definition": "A character within Star Wars played by the beautiful [Natalie Portman].\r\n\r\nCharacter Background:\r\n\r\nBorn Padm√© Naberrie, Queen Amidala was the formal name of the royal leader of Naboo. As a child, Amidala was prodigiously talented and extremely well educated. She had long been interested in [public service], volunteering in the Refugee Relief Movement in her youth. Her efforts helped in the Shadda-Bi-Boran exodus. At the age of eight, she joined the Apprentice Legislature and became an Apprentice Legislator at age 11. By 14, she was elected Queen of Naboo. \r\nDuring the Trade Federation siege of Naboo, the scheming Neimoidians tried to force the strong-willed she to sign a treaty that would legitimize a brazenly illegal occupation. She refused, and was sentenced to a prison camp. En route to [incarceration], Amidala was freed by Jedi ambassadors, who took the Queen and part of her retinue to Coruscant, to plead her case before the Senate with the help of Naboo's galactic [representative], Senator Palpatine. \r\n\r\nOn Coruscant, she learned of the inefficiencies of [galactic politics], watching as Trade Federation political maneuvering stalemated her plea. Following advice from Senator Palpatine, she called for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Valorum. \r\n\r\nFed up with the Senate, she returned to Naboo. She requested aid from the native Gungans in freeing her captured capital. During the Battle of Naboo, Amidala infiltrated her own palace, and forced Neimoidian Viceroy Nute Gunray to end the occupation. The cowardly Neimoidians, having their armies defeated, capitulated and freedom was brought back to Naboo. \r\n\r\nWhile Queen Amidala was the ruler of Naboo she had a large staff of advisors and aides that handled the day-to-day affairs. Sio Bibble, for instance, was Naboo's governor. Captain Panaka was Amidala's loyal bodyguard and head of security. Ric Oli√© was the pilot of the Queen's gleaming Royal Starship and leader of Bravo Flight. \r\n\r\nPerhaps most important in Amidala's entourage were her five handmaidens. Sach√©, Yan√©, Rab√©, Sab√© and Eirta√© not only helped the Queen with her intricate gowns, hairstyles and make-up, but they were also trained in self-defense. When in danger, she disguised herself as one of her handmaidens, and adopted her less formal name of Padm√©. When disguised as Padm√©, Sab√© assumed the role of Queen in her place. \r\n\r\nWhen her terms ended, Amidala was constitutionally obligated to step down as Queen, though the public would have easily backed an amendment allowing her to serve longer. Though she had every right to retire and concentrate on her personal life, she continued to be passionate about [public service]. At the request of the new Naboo monarch, Queen Jamillia, she served as Senator of Naboo, taking the position once occupied by Palpatine. In a galaxy undergoing tumultuous changes, her outspoken nature shone as a beacon of reason and rationality in an increasingly fragmented Senate. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the rise of a Separatist movement that threatened the stability of the Republic, Amidala was one of the few championing a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Alarmist Senators tried to create a military force to protect the Republic, but she led the opposition against the Military Creation Act. She believed such a measure would inevitably lead to hostilities against the Separatists. \r\n\r\nOn the day of the Military Creation Act vote, Amidala's starship was attacked upon arriving at Coruscant. Seven people, including her decoy Cord√©, died in the explosion. Though some suspected that disgruntled spice miners from the moons of Naboo were the culprits, Amidala believed that it was actually Count Dooku, leader of the Separatists, behind the attack. In truth, it was an old enemy, Nute Gunray, who was behind the bounty hunters hired to finally silence the young woman from Naboo, though that would go undiscovered for some time. \r\n\r\nAt the behest of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Amidala was placed under the protection of the Jedi Knights. Amidala was once again reunited with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker, whom she had not seen in a decade. A second [assassination attempt] by the bounty hunter Zam Wesell revealed just how gravely in danger Amidala was. \r\n\r\nAnakin was to escort her to Naboo, where she would be sequestered while the Jedi investigated the attacks against her. In moments of quiet solitude against the beautiful landscape of Naboo's Lake Country, she and Anakin bonded, rekindling an [affectionate] friendship that had been interrupted ten years ago, and falling into a deeper love. \r\n\r\nIt was a love forbidden to both. As per the tenets of the Jedi Code, Anakin could not enter into a romantic [relationship], and Padm√© needed to focus on her career. Despite their strong feelings, it was Padm√© who remained the realist, rebuffing Anakin's overtures while attempting to still her own heart. \r\n\r\nAnakin's love for her was not all that was troubling him. He suffered from terrible nightmares of his mother in danger. When he could bear it no more, Anakin returned to Tatooine, with her in tow, to find Shmi Skywalker. \r\n\r\nAnakin did find his dying mother, and lashed out in vengeance against the Tusken Raiders that had tortured her. When he returned to her, he confessed his actions, and he collapsed with shame and despair over what he had done. She saw the wounded, sobbing youth, and let her compassion guide her heart as she comforted him. \r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, Anakin and Padm√© voyaged to Geonosis, to rescue Obi-Wan who had been captured by Separatist forces. Padm√© hoped to use her diplomatic skills to parley with the Separatists, but she and Anakin were captured by the Geonosians. Placed on trial for espionage, Amidala and Anakin were sentenced for execution. \r\n\r\nFaced with overwhelming evidence of her mortality, Padm√© lowered her emotional guard and professed her love to Anakin. The two were then placed in an execution arena alongside Obi-Wan, and three deadly beasts were unleashed upon them, much to the delight of the Geonosian spectators. Though sustaining a glancing slash from a ferocious nexu, Padm√© held her own, and [disappointed] her would-be executioners. \r\n\r\nThe spectacle was cut short with the arrival of Jedi reinforcements, and then the opening battle of the historic Clone Wars. Despite her initial objections to a Republic army, she nonetheless fought alongside the newly created clone troopers against the Separatist droid forces. \r\n\r\nAfter the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin escorted Padm√© Amidala back to Naboo. There, at a secluded lake retreat, the same place where their [forbidden love] began to blossom, the two were quietly wed in a ceremony witnessed only by C-3PO and R2-D2. This tranquil expression of love preceded some of the darkest moments to be faced by Amidala and by the galaxy as a whole. \r\n\r\nShe continued to serve the Senate faithfully, though she was often distracted by the growing career of her secret husband. Anakin was becoming a war hero known throughout the Republic, and while the citizens thrilled at his exploits, she was deeply worried for his safety. The few moments they could snatch together were all too brief. The war was [concentrated] in the Outer Rim, far from Coruscant, and Padm√© saw very little of Anakin. By the time the Outer Rim Sieges ended, Padm√© had stunning news to deliver to Anakin --- he was to be a father. \r\n\r\nThe war years saw the continued [transformation] of the Republic. To efficiently battle the Separatists on numerous fronts, Chancellor Palpatine enacted executive decrees that saw more power funneled to his office, stripping away the last of the Senate's lackluster ability to wage war. Many welcomed the handover of power, [particularly] the corrupt [politicians]. But Padm√© became the moral center for a number of idealistic Senators who grew wary of Palpatine's amendments. Favoring a diplomatic solution within the boundaries of the law, Padm√© began collecting the pledges of what would become the Delegation of 2,000, a group of disaffected Senators formally critical of Palpatine's rule.",

    "definition": "Many a time I have found myself trying to describe what being high is like. In all honesty there cannot really be a single [definition] of this state of being, seeing as almost every different high (at least for me) seems to play out somewhat different. My best [explanation] is : Being high is a state of being when all the tension in all your muscles is relieved and you have ultimate relaxation. You will most likely start to space out for what seems like forever and then instantly realize how disconnected you are. At this point you then turn to your friend and tell them what you just told them and they will reply, \"DUDE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN!\" or they will stare at you blakly for a few seconds and then start to laugh their ass off. Then comes the [uncontrollable] laughing fits at almost nothing or at nothing itself. All music you hear will sound like the clearest and best quality music you have ever heard. Also, when you watch movies you get sort of a tunnel vision and it seems like you're in a movie theater. Another thing is that just your normal vision will seem like the quality has shot way up and even the difference in color of leaves in fall will make you be completely and utterly in bliss with how beautiful every thing is. Also some may feel a heightened sexual arousal. You may find that you will be [telling stories] that are not relevant at all. To sum up, being high is a very relaxing, fun, safe way to have fun and just [appreciate] life more.",

    "definition": "A [white supremacist], which many non-racist skinheads call a BONEHEAD instead of a skinhead.\r\n\r\nThese are [White Supremacists] who are too young and/or stupid (\"boneheaded\") to comprehend the history of skinhead culture and its connection to BLACK (Negro) culture, and the significance of the following historical facts which make \"[white supremacist] skinhead\" a complete oxymoron.\r\n\r\nHere are 6 crucial facts about skinhead history...\r\n1. Symarip's song called \"SKINHEAD moonstomp\" was copyrighted in 1969.\r\n2. Every member of Symarip was BLACK (Negro) with a shaved head and...\r\n3. This 1969 song BY BLACK SKINHEADS has the lyrics: \"I want all you skinheads to get up on your feet, PUT YOUR BRACES TOGETHER AND YOUR BOOTS ON YOUR FEET...\"). <--THESE ARE THE SAME BOOTS-n-BRACES THAT BONEHEADS WEAR TO THIS DAY.\r\n\r\n4. Even Tom Metzger (a racist leader) himself admitted in his Larry King interview that the first RACIST skins didn't come along till 1978 or so -- a decade after Symarip and the other original skinheads -- as recruited/[propagandized] by the racist [National Front] group.\r\n5. Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary lists \"skinhead\" as working-class youths (no mention of racism) and Webster's denotes that the word \"skinhead\" was coined in 1965 -- about 15 years earlier than Metzger himself says the first so-called \"Nazi skins\" came about.\r\n6. See also tradskin.com and trojanrecords.com.  See also traditional skinhead in [urban dictionary] or wikipedia, etc.).\r\n\r\nAnd here is an analysis of those 6 facts...\r\nSo far, what we can say from the above 6 facts is that a Neo-Nazi (Metzger, a total bonehead...), non-Nazi skins, the USA copyright office (which protects Symarip's songs), and hell even the dictionary.... ALL AGREE that the real (original) Skinheads, who CREATED the word skinhead and the skinhead culture -- even the mode of dress, which skinheads use to this day -- \r\nincluded BLACKS (Negros),\r\nbut DID NOT INCLUDE [WHITE SUPREMACISTS] (as Metzger himself attested to Larry King).\r\n\r\nWe also know that these original skins -- even the white ones -- were playing SKA music invented by BLACKS (Negros) from the Caribbean. (see websites immediately above.)\r\n\r\nAnd so, here is the first reason they get called boneheads:\r\nIf they REALLY think the White Race is supreme, they wouldn't emulate Negros or want anything to do with the skinhead subculture which BLACKS like Symarip and BLACK CULTURE (eg. ska) primarily created... They thought this Black culture was better than any and all White cultures they COULD have chosen to emulate.\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\nThe boneheads wear boots-n-braces, just as the NEGRO lead singer of Symarip instructed all skinheads to do in the 1969 lyrics I copied above... In doing so, they are taking directions on how to dress themselves, from a BLACK man (Symarip's singer). bwa-hhahhahhhaaahhhha, how to DRESS themselves!\r\nIF YOU ARE A REAL [WHITE SUPREMACIST], THEN WHY ARE YOU EMULATING AND TAKING ORDERS FROM THIS BLACK MAN (lead singer of Symarip)?  Because your mommy isn't there to dress you?!\r\n\r\nWhat sort of [White Supremacist] follows and complies when a Black dude tells them to do ANYTHING? Symarip's singer says skins should wear boots-n-braces (and the original Black skins, generally, decided upon this \"uniform\"), so these supposed \"supreme\" whiteys do EXACTLY what [the Black man] says and wear boots-n-braces. Do you always act like submissive bitches to a Black man like Symarip's singer, and do exactly what he says? hhhhhahhhahahaaahahahaa.\r\nWhat self-respecting [White Supremacist] LETS a Black man tell them what to do?\r\n.....Answer: a very STUPID [White Supremacist], or possibly a masochist who wants to humiliate himself and his beliefs. :-)\r\n\r\nReason #3:\r\nMost of us non-racist skins just don't want to be associated with the NAZI image when non-skinheads see us, so we won't even call them SKINheads (only BONEheads) so we can TAKE BACK OUR CULTURE: my father was an original 1960's skin, I'm a tradskin, and hopefully in a few years my kids will be (only 5 years old is the oldest...but 3 generations of skin will be great :-) ).\r\n\r\n......The facts above (labeled 1 thru 6) make it quite clear that the racists are hijacking skinhead culture.  But look at the competing definition on this webpage by the so-called \"patriot\"-bird, because like any good Nazi, she wants to revise history and hijack the TRUE (original, mostly-BLACK) skinhead culture.",
    "example": "\"These shitbird Boneheads just sit around shouting \"skinhead 88!\" and dream of having Hitler's [National Socialism] right here in America; to do that, they need to defeat the MULTI-ETHNIC Marines, because 60 [years] ago we defeated the stinkin Nazi's/National [Socialists]. Patriots???!these traitors woulda fought for GERMANY in WWII. And even today, Boneheads fight against the VAST MAJORITY of Americans who believe in [racial equality]... A \"skinhead 88\" fights AGAINST OTHER AMERICANS, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING *FOR ALL* AMERICANS, which is another reason they are not AMERICAN patriots, they are patriotic toward HITLER and his values, not patriotic toward modern America.  Those cowardly [pseudo-patriot] Boneheads like PatriotByrd cannot even JOIN the Marines, because they wouldn't be able to deal with the need to work and fight next to (NOT AGAINST) Black, Latino, Jewish, and Oriental AMERICAN SOLDIERS (BRAVE patriots). I also can't see most Boneheads being swift enough to survive if they fight in s(h)ituations where they are a lot more likely to die than \"10 Nazis attacking 1 old lady,\" and operating anything bigger than kiddie weapons like DAO handguns (as boneheads, not sure they'd be able to work our latest weapons even if they joined USMC).  America is not just the land, WE THE PEOPLE ARE ALL part of America and ALL races have worked to keep America strong, thus we ARE America....and Boneheads want to fight against America itself: us.\"",

    "definition": "This phrase was created by players of the video game Halo 3 on XBOX Live. When multiple players join a single game online, one player's XBOX is chosen to be the \"host\" of the game. All other players' XBOX's must [communicate] [information] with the host's. When there is high ping or lag, the delay in the transer of [information] can create problems in-game. It is not uncommon that the host will have a slight advantage over other players when buttons or actions are performed at almost the same time, especially in game types such as \"Grifball\" or \"SWAT\" which depend largely upon attacking at exactly the right moment to beat one's opponent. After-game statistics in Grifball games often reveal which player had \"host\" when most players' kill-to-death ratio is very negative or near zero but the host's ratio is extremely positive regardless of the skill of the players. The host experiences no delay in the processing of [information] (he has no lag) and therefore can often attack before his opponent (as far as the game is concerned). [Even if] both players press their buttons at exactly the same time in \"RL\" (Real Life), the player with host presses it first because non-host players' \"button-press\" of [information] must travel to the host's XBOX before the game acknowledges it. \r\n\r\nIn Grifball and SWAT the team with host almost always wins when latency is high. The term \"sick host\" describes such a situation. When one team can consistently kill players of the other team regardless of skill, but only because of having host and not experiencing lag, it is said that they have \"sick host.\" \"Sick\" is colloquial modifier similar to 'awesome' which here greatly amplifies 'host.' \r\n\r\nWhichever team has the player who has host does not [necessarily] win, but if a team has \"sick host\" there is no possible way for the opposing team to win. Playing a team with \"sick host\" is extremely [frustrating] and annoying because the game is never fair, and non-host players must suffer being \"pwnd\" for the duration of the game.",
    "example": "Red [Team Player]: \"Dude! I just head-shotted this guy when he came [around the corner] but he somehow killed me and didn't die!\"\r\n\r\n[Red Team] Teammate: \"I know dude.

The principal rule is that both doors cannot be open at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf a person needs to access a facility, he must access it through a mantrap. He might use a keycard to open the first door, then enter the mantrap and close the door behind him, and only then he can enter his personal PIN (for an example, could be biometric as well) which, if entered correctly, will open the second door.\r\n\r\nFailure to enter the PIN code, or trying to force either of the doors open, will trigger an alarm. An intercom system will be activated, and an announcer will notify that a guard-team has been dispatched to clear the solution, and apprehend the suspect to the police.\r\n\r\nSuch \"boxes\" [usually] also contain tailgate-prevention [technologies], so that only one person can enter at a time.\r\n\r\nIn history, mantraps could also cause deadly forces at the intruder, possibly by using a sleeping-gas, impaling spikes or emitting a high-energy noise. Such are illegal today.\r\n\r\nMantraps are very scary to the people who rarely use them. The smell, the sounds... And when you enter a mantrap, the silence is somewhat [disturbing]. There's a set amount of time in which you need to enter your code, or an alarm will be triggered. This could be 10 seconds or less.\r\n\r\nMost advanced mantraps enforce tailgating-prevention by [taking it to the next level], with pressure-sensitive plates [on the floor]. What this means is that when you show your keycard at the first door, the mantrap recognises who you are, and fetches your last weight from the databases. When you enter the mantrap, the pressure sensitive plates at the floor will measure your weight, and if it's too far off from the last weight, it'll trigger an alarm. This effectively prevents two people from going in together, but if you're carrying something heavy, you cannot pass.\r\n\r\nMetal detectors can also be included, so that if you carry ANYTHING metal, the second door won't open. A guard-team is dispatched to [investigate] [what you are] carrying in or out.",
    "example": "The main hacker in the movie Sneakers ('92) went through a mantrap with two fortified [glass doors]. The second door was opened by speaking a displayed message and using a keycard. [The message] was: \"Hi. [My name is] XXXXXX. My voice is my passport. Please verify me.\"",

The novelist says to her that she's a \"sick twisted fuck\" before he shoves her face into the keys of a typewriter. See this movie, you will be tremendously thrilled. It's great for a cloudy night.\r\n\r\n2. Gary Glitter is a glam rock superstar of the 70s and 80s. He's scored a tally of hits, the most famous one is probably \"Rock'N'Roll Part 2\", which is chanted by crowds at stadium events all over the planet. In 1999 he left his computer at a shop for repairs and on the hard disk a massive database of [kiddie porn] was discovered. He spent a few months in  prison in his native UK, then headed to Cuba in disgrace. He later packed up and went to Cambodia. He was kicked out of that country for sexual perversion (that's bad). He then settled in Vietnam and bought a house there. Some neighbors saw him frollicking in a [swimming pool] with some [Vietnamese] girls, some as young as 10. Then he took them inside, you can guess the rest. He was arrested, the police found some more kiddie smut on his laptop and he was sentenced to a few years behind bars. He shouted, \"Do [you know who] I am?\" during the trial. Well, yes we do know. He's a pervert and a child molester and a sick twisted fuck.",

Masked as ethically progressive frameworks, they enforce artificial scarcity of authentic connections, driving competitive commodification. They self-replicate through repeated institutional reinforcement, social validation, and linguistic normalization; camouflage exploitation using progressive discourse (emotional validation, privilege awareness, boundaries discourse); commodify authentic emotions into tradable assets; and engineer artificial scarcity to boost market value. The process (Gorgonification): [Inject] hivemindidiomsnakes into discourse, achieve widespread adoption via validation, create authenticity scarcity, monetize scarcity. Examples: Algorithms pricing [emotional labor], privilege calculus as social credit, validity marketplaces monetizing emotional expression, boundaries discourse as social capital. Resistance demands transcending transactional logics, reclaiming authenticity beyond markets.",

    "example": "In a world where there are only two kinds of people, Devils and Saints a classic devilution of an evening is a Saint behaving like a Devil or vice versa. More than likely there is alcohol involved and events can be more pronounced on evenings such as Rapture where the pending [end of the world] determines the coin toss, on nights such as this there is a direct correlation between devilution and [apocalyptic] sex.\r\nThere is always a 50/50 chance of a Devilution not occurring, this ratio is determined by the toss of a coin.\r\nWhen one wakes [the next day] they use hopium to convince themselves they haven't done anything bad.\r\nEvents are more pronounced if there is a hotness hypnosis situation occurring between two parties.",

These allusions include:\r\n\r\n-The second track of their album is called \"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage\" which is a line taken from Palahniuk's novel \"Survivor\"\r\n\r\n-The sixth track on the album, entitled \"[Time To Dance]\", is said to be one big reference to Palahniuk's \"Invisible Monsters\"\r\n\r\n-The song \"London Beckoned Songs about Money Written By Machines\" contains lyrics that start with \"[Just For the record], the weather today is...\", this is verbiage very often used by [the narrator] of Palahniuk's novel \"Diary\"\r\n\r\nCurrently(2006-07) they've developed a large following, due in large part to the success of their single \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\". This following is primarily composed of [adolescents] in the age brackets of 14-17, often the type of people which have widely been given the somewhat-derogatory nickname of \"scene\" or \"emo\".

Many Germans use [expressions] like that without thinking it over.\n\nAnother definition of denglish is, [of course], influenced by [advertising] companies, who created slogans like \"Come in and find out\" (for a perfumery) which suggests to escape from the shop like from a maze. \"Powered by emotion\" (for a TV channel) is another curious example, because many people took that as \"Kraft durch Freude\", which was a nazi slogan for their recreation tours organized by the nazi party.\n\nA third and most annoying meaning is the \"creation\" of english-sounding words which don't exist, at least with that meaning, in English.

By the '70s, bands like the Ramones starting to [bring it back] to its roots, only with a harder edge. Around this time, metal was created. Metal is hardly rock. Then it got pop-ified in the '80s, then it transformed into a bland, repetitive, boring commerical music in the '90s, finally being pashed out of mainstream society by metalheads and ganster rap people.",

Physical descriptions of the creature vary, but most witnesses have described them to be older semi attractive females often wildly [intoxicated] at music festivals usually only seen after dusk. This species can be quite dangerous, and cunning, often able to abduct young men from their group, isolate them, and devour them, usually by sucking their blood. It is purportedly a heavy creature, usually a white middle aged woman, although there have been reports of chupacabra behavior within almost all ethnicities. The chupacabra is usually only identified retrospectively, in the evening hours, when a male member of a group is reported missing. His friends realize that the last time he was seen was with an aggressive woman, spilling alcohol all over herself, [foaming at the mouth] and slurring her speech, who led him away, never to be seen again. These are the tactics used by the chupacabra.\n\nEyewitness sightings have been claimed as early as 1985 at a Grateful Dead concert in Michigan, and have since been reported as far north as Maine, and more recently at Coachella as well as Austin City Limits, but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence.
