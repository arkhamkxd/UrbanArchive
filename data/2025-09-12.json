He's always up for a challenge, he'll probably succeed and he seems to be good at everything. But at the same time, the badass attitude is like: \"ok well [I don't give a shit]\".\r\n\r\nGenuinely intriguing and intrigued by others, he radiates confidence in everything he does and fears nobody. He won't pick a fight but DO NOT fuck with him, because he will [beat the shit out of] you with his bare hands. He's taken more punches to the face than you have, and he's probably busted a few knuckles (on more than just the [kitchen cabinets] in the dark). Treats people with respect up to the point where they cross the line with him. Keeps his cool but won't be pushed around.
