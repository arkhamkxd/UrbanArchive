He's always up for a challenge, he'll probably succeed and he seems to be good at everything. But at the same time, the badass attitude is like: \"ok well [I don't give a shit]\".\r\n\r\nGenuinely intriguing and intrigued by others, he radiates confidence in everything he does and fears nobody. He won't pick a fight but DO NOT fuck with him, because he will [beat the shit out of] you with his bare hands. He's taken more punches to the face than you have, and he's probably busted a few knuckles (on more than just the [kitchen cabinets] in the dark).

    "word": "Satanist",
    "definition": "Spiritual Satanism, like \"Traditional Satanism,\" differs from LaVeyan Satanism. We are aware of the existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an “archetype.” \r\n\r\nMany Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him as a friend and do not worship. We respect [individuality] and personal choices. One's [relationship] with Satan/Lucifer is up to the individual, as Satanism values free thought and [individuality]. \r\n\r\nSatan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is to apply this knowledge. Spiritual Satanists do not just talk the talk about becoming a god; we work at it every day. Satan and his Demons guide us to use abilities we never even knew we had. We accomplish this through power meditation. \r\n\r\nUnlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question everything. Satan is the bringer of knowledge and enlightenment. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's brains to their maximum potential. \r\nSpiritual Satanism does not in any way conflict with science. We strongly encourage and support all scientific knowledge and enquiry. We are well aware humanity is dangerously behind in scientific knowledge and [understanding] due to centuries of oppression by [Christianity]. We believe that all spiritual and paranormal phenomena can be scientifically explained in a rational manner; scientific knowledge has not yet progressed far enough to comprehend or explain much of the so-called \"supernatural.\" \r\n\r\nThere are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism. We strongly encourage our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for guidance and support only. One's [relationship] with Satan is between that individual and Satan. We take the stance of \"[responsibility] to the responsible.\" We place no limitations on knowledge or personal power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed \"elite\" as with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct experience. \r\n\r\nMost Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his people to live life to the fullest and to evolve. \r\n\r\nSatan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to handle things as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers. [Christianity] and other it s other related religions make cripples out of people. Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people. These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to, nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene only taught slavery and servitude; how to take abuse, never anything to advance humanity. Any healings have been very few and far between; the nefarious aliens being pressed to put make a show every now and then. With the New Age practitioners, many call upon angels for assistance and learn nothing. The same theme of human ignorance and powerlessness prevails. \r\n\r\nSatan gives us the knowledge to become independent and free. He directs us to be masters of our own lives and destinies. Satan and his Demons are always there to help us when there are things we cannot yet handle. \r\n\r\nSatan keeps his promises; he is consistent and loving with his own. Satan stands for freedom, strength, power, and justice. Satan shows us it is NOT OK for us to take abuse. He shows us that we are deserving of pleasure, happiness and a better life. Satan/Lucifer is the True Creator God of, and [the great liberator] of humanity. He created us through genetic engineering, the same as scientists are now creating clones and working with genetics, but only on a much more advanced level. \r\n\r\nMany people disregard so-called “occult” power, they do not take it seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries. Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the populace. Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam, knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found. \r\n\r\nCities, libraries and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and banished. \r\n\r\nHumanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has devolved ever since. The abuse of children, animals, careless destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other living creatures are somoe of the effects of spiritual degeneration. Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity, humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as \"The Golden Age.\" \r\n\r\nSatan is the Sumerian God known as \"EA\" or \"ENKI.\" He is a GOD, not an angel! He has been denigrated and slandered through the centuries with falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away from Satan. \r\n\r\nSatan is the most brilliant of the Gods. He also ruled Egypt under the name \"PTAH.\" \"ENKI\" means Lord/Ruler of the Earth. He is symbolized by the Water Bearer of the sign of Aquarius, the 11th sign of the Zodiac. Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One of Satan's numbers is 11. \r\n\r\nSatan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also known as \"The Brotherhood of the Snake.\" Through the millennia, the teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power. This knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for nefarious ends under the direction of the entities known as “jehova” and company. To reveal these well-kept secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would no longer retain their power. \r\n\r\nThe Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings of which Satan is supreme and omnipresent. In the Christian bible, they are referred to as the \"Nephilim.\" These beings are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age. They exist out in the cosmos. \"Hell\" is out in the cosmos in the area known as \"The Duat.\" Azazel relates that “Hell” is near the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. \r\n\r\nIn the Necronomicon (this book is based upon Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of fiction), the phrase: \"When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky\" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will return. \r\n\r\nHumanity’s sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered children with human mothers These offspring were known as \"Demi-Gods.\" “Noah” (his real name was Ziusudra) was a son of Satan. Satan saved his life, along with his family, by relating to him information concerning the impending flood. This same catastrophe possibly wiped out the dinosaurs, millions of years earlier. Nibiru (the home planet of the Gods), is said to return to the asteroid belt every 3,600 years. Because of the immense size and [gravitational pull] of the planet, the Antarctic ice cap slips creating torrential rains and flooding. This is where in the Christian bible, it is written, \"the Sun will become black as sack cloth and the Moon will become blood red.\" Nibiru will eclipse the Earth. \r\n\r\nSexual relations with and intermarriage with humans angered the other Gods who looked down upon humanity and wished for our destruction. Interbreeding with the Gods gave humans capabilities that they had not intended for us to have. Father Satan wished for us to have equality with the Gods. \r\n\r\nSatan is incredibly strong, brilliant, and powerful. He refused to admit defeat. He lost a battle, but not the war. Since then, many others have defected from the tyranny of the enemy to join Satan in his fight. Satan has become, once again, extremely powerful. In spite of smaller numbers, he is winning. As Satanists, we can feel his strength. Christians are weak because their energy is used and manipulated by “Jehova” and they remain ignorant. One Satanist is worth many Christians. SATAN/LUCIFER STANDS FOR [FREEDOM FROM] TYRANNY! \r\n\r\nDOES SATAN REALLY EXIST? \r\nYes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us know of his presence. If you doubt whether he exists, just ask him. \r\n\r\nDemons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual attention and protection, once a strong and trusted [relationship] is established. When we are close to, and under the protection of Satan, he gives us good Demons to work with. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the helpful Demons Satan provides us with, angels are cruel, unfeeling, sadistic, and evil beings who look down upon humanity. One only needs to look at the Christian bible, especially the book of revelation. Angels have repeatedly been messengers of misfortune and instigators of mass murder. \r\nMany times, beings and entities from the Christian “god” will masquerade as Demons, or spirits of Satan. Remember, the Christian “god” uses ignorance and fear to enslave humanity. People who are open to Christianity or actual Christians are the most vulnerable to negative influences. Some who investigate Satanism and the occult have a bad or terrifying experience, go running back to Christianity, more holy than ever before, and rant about how \"evil\" Satan is, when all along it was the Christian god and his angelss, frightening them back into the fold. This is because they lack the necessary knowledge. Fear is one of the most effective tools used by the Christian “god.” Fear is only effective if there is a lack of knowledge. \r\n\r\nSatan is not \"evil,\" nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. One only needs to look to the Christian bible, to see all of the curses, punishments, and afflictions their so-called \"God\" has inflicted upon humanity. Now here is real abuse of psychic power, and those who do not stop to think are deluded into believing humanity is not worthy of it. Jehova uses black magick to enslave and inflict suffering upon humans and many others. \r\n\r\nSatan has given us modern medicine (whose sign is the serpent), while it is not yet perfect, it has saved many lives and healed billions of people. Satan has given us knowledge that has elevated humanity above that of an animal. All modern conveniences and technology are from Satan as well as spiritual knowledge that give us true power and advance our souls. Satanism stands for the balance of spirituality with technology. Without this balance, civilizations eventually collapse. \r\n\r\n“Hell” is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close to Satan, have seen “Hell.” We all seem to have had the same experiences. Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in other places there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color. I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, [playing cards]. The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. \r\n\r\nSATANIC SACRAMENTS \r\n\r\nWith Christianity, one is expected to give their soul without question. Infants are baptized; children around six years of age are given communion and there are no informed choices. [Little children] say bedtime prayers, asking the Christian \"god\" to take their souls, if they \"die before they wake.\" First of all YOUR SOUL IS YOU and ONLY YOU should have a right to do with it, as YOU see fit. No one should have the right to demand your soul, as have the Christians and their \"god” for centuries. Christians are forever preaching the concept of \"free will,\" but are nothing but a bunch of liars and hypocrites as they are the most aggressive violaters of \"free will\" and always have been, with centuries of resorting to torture and mass murder to coerce people into worshipping their \"god.\" \r\n\r\nThe arrogant Christian god, which is really more than one entity as we can see with the new age movement, (angels are beginning to reveal themselves and their appearance is far different than the white winged beings most people believe they are seeing), in his degrading attitude towards humanity, feels he is entitled. Souls are harvested for energy if deemed fit. \r\n\r\nMany Satanists dedicate their souls to Satan, as I have. There are reasons for this. In truth, the soul we save is our own. Satan guides us and empowers us to advance to a higher spiritual level where we are no longer enslaved with ignorance. Deluded, foolish Christians can pray for us and harass all they want to. In truth, the “saved” campaign is nothing more than another deception and lie. The Nazarene was invented to keep people from saving their own souls. He is and has been nothing more than a distraction to keep humanity from advancing spiritually. Christians are deluded into believing they will be miraculously saved by the Nazarene who was nothing more than a human blood sacrifice for “Jehova”. They are deluded into doing nothing spiritually and most know nothing about their souls. \r\n\r\nWe are under Satan's protection. Satan is very protective of his people. Disciples of Satan don't have to ride around in a bullet proof armored personnel carrier, like the Catholic Pope. Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey and other high profile Satanists have died of natural causes in spite of having a plethora of enemies. \r\n\r\nOnce a commitment is made, Satan begins investing in you. Most Satanists are extremely evolved compared to outsiders. Many non-Satanists are into the occult and are stuck at square one when it comes to [understanding], knowledge, and ability. They often meet with disaster, because they lack the necessary spiritual protection. Jehova and his angels are serious about working to stop humans from advancing. \r\n\r\nAs opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way about blood sacrifice. This is of Jehova and can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The serpent/snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened. We have our own power, and do not need outside sources as does “Jehova” and company.",
