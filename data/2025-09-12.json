He's always up for a challenge, he'll probably succeed and he seems to be good at everything. But at the same time, the badass attitude is like: \"ok well [I don't give a shit]\".\r\n\r\nGenuinely intriguing and intrigued by others, he radiates confidence in everything he does and fears nobody. He won't pick a fight but DO NOT fuck with him, because he will [beat the shit out of] you with his bare hands. He's taken more punches to the face than you have, and he's probably busted a few knuckles (on more than just the [kitchen cabinets] in the dark).

    "word": "Satanist",
    "definition": "Spiritual Satanism, like \"Traditional Satanism,\" differs from LaVeyan Satanism. We are aware of the existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an “archetype.” \r\n\r\nMany Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him as a friend and do not worship. We respect [individuality] and personal choices. One's [relationship] with Satan/Lucifer is up to the individual, as Satanism values free thought and [individuality]. \r\n\r\nSatan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is to apply this knowledge. Spiritual Satanists do not just talk the talk about becoming a god; we work at it every day. Satan and his Demons guide us to use abilities we never even knew we had. We accomplish this through power meditation. \r\n\r\nUnlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question everything. Satan is the bringer of knowledge and enlightenment. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's brains to their maximum potential. \r\nSpiritual Satanism does not in any way conflict with science. We strongly encourage and support all scientific knowledge and enquiry. We are well aware humanity is dangerously behind in scientific knowledge and [understanding] due to centuries of oppression by [Christianity]. We believe that all spiritual and paranormal phenomena can be scientifically explained in a rational manner; scientific knowledge has not yet progressed far enough to comprehend or explain much of the so-called \"supernatural.\" \r\n\r\nThere are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism. We strongly encourage our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for guidance and support only. One's [relationship] with Satan is between that individual and Satan. We take the stance of \"[responsibility] to the responsible.\" We place no limitations on knowledge or personal power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed \"elite\" as with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct experience. \r\n\r\nMost Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his people to live life to the fullest and to evolve. \r\n\r\nSatan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to handle things as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers. [Christianity] and other it s other related religions make cripples out of people. Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people. These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to, nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene only taught slavery and servitude; how to take abuse, never anything to advance humanity. Any healings have been very few and far between; the nefarious aliens being pressed to put make a show every now and then. With the New Age practitioners, many call upon angels for assistance and learn nothing. The same theme of human ignorance and powerlessness prevails. \r\n\r\nSatan gives us the knowledge to become independent and free. He directs us to be masters of our own lives and destinies. Satan and his Demons are always there to help us when there are things we cannot yet handle. \r\n\r\nSatan keeps his promises; he is consistent and loving with his own. Satan stands for freedom, strength, power, and justice. Satan shows us it is NOT OK for us to take abuse. He shows us that we are deserving of pleasure, happiness and a better life. Satan/Lucifer is the True Creator God of, and [the great liberator] of humanity. He created us through genetic engineering, the same as scientists are now creating clones and working with genetics, but only on a much more advanced level. \r\n\r\nMany people disregard so-called “occult” power, they do not take it seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries. Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the populace. Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam, knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found. \r\n\r\nCities, libraries and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and banished. \r\n\r\nHumanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has devolved ever since. The abuse of children, animals, careless destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other living creatures are somoe of the effects of spiritual degeneration. Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity, humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as \"The Golden Age.\" \r\n\r\nSatan is the Sumerian God known as \"EA\" or \"ENKI.\" He is a GOD, not an angel! He has been denigrated and slandered through the centuries with falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away from Satan. \r\n\r\nSatan is the most brilliant of the Gods. He also ruled Egypt under the name \"PTAH.\" \"ENKI\" means Lord/Ruler of the Earth. He is symbolized by the Water Bearer of the sign of Aquarius, the 11th sign of the Zodiac. Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One of Satan's numbers is 11. \r\n\r\nSatan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also known as \"The Brotherhood of the Snake.\" Through the millennia, the teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power. This knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for nefarious ends under the direction of the entities known as “jehova” and company. To reveal these well-kept secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would no longer retain their power. \r\n\r\nThe Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings of which Satan is supreme and omnipresent. In the Christian bible, they are referred to as the \"Nephilim.\" These beings are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age. They exist out in the cosmos. \"Hell\" is out in the cosmos in the area known as \"The Duat.\" Azazel relates that “Hell” is near the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. \r\n\r\nIn the Necronomicon (this book is based upon Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of fiction), the phrase: \"When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky\" refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will return. \r\n\r\nHumanity’s sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered children with human mothers These offspring were known as \"Demi-Gods.\" “Noah” (his real name was Ziusudra) was a son of Satan. Satan saved his life, along with his family, by relating to him information concerning the impending flood. This same catastrophe possibly wiped out the dinosaurs, millions of years earlier. Nibiru (the home planet of the Gods), is said to return to the asteroid belt every 3,600 years. Because of the immense size and [gravitational pull] of the planet, the Antarctic ice cap slips creating torrential rains and flooding. This is where in the Christian bible, it is written, \"the Sun will become black as sack cloth and the Moon will become blood red.\" Nibiru will eclipse the Earth. \r\n\r\nSexual relations with and intermarriage with humans angered the other Gods who looked down upon humanity and wished for our destruction. Interbreeding with the Gods gave humans capabilities that they had not intended for us to have. Father Satan wished for us to have equality with the Gods. \r\n\r\nSatan is incredibly strong, brilliant, and powerful. He refused to admit defeat. He lost a battle, but not the war. Since then, many others have defected from the tyranny of the enemy to join Satan in his fight. Satan has become, once again, extremely powerful. In spite of smaller numbers, he is winning. As Satanists, we can feel his strength. Christians are weak because their energy is used and manipulated by “Jehova” and they remain ignorant. One Satanist is worth many Christians. SATAN/LUCIFER STANDS FOR [FREEDOM FROM] TYRANNY! \r\n\r\nDOES SATAN REALLY EXIST? \r\nYes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us know of his presence. If you doubt whether he exists, just ask him. \r\n\r\nDemons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual attention and protection, once a strong and trusted [relationship] is established. When we are close to, and under the protection of Satan, he gives us good Demons to work with. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the helpful Demons Satan provides us with, angels are cruel, unfeeling, sadistic, and evil beings who look down upon humanity. One only needs to look at the Christian bible, especially the book of revelation. Angels have repeatedly been messengers of misfortune and instigators of mass murder. \r\nMany times, beings and entities from the Christian “god” will masquerade as Demons, or spirits of Satan. Remember, the Christian “god” uses ignorance and fear to enslave humanity. People who are open to Christianity or actual Christians are the most vulnerable to negative influences. Some who investigate Satanism and the occult have a bad or terrifying experience, go running back to Christianity, more holy than ever before, and rant about how \"evil\" Satan is, when all along it was the Christian god and his angelss, frightening them back into the fold. This is because they lack the necessary knowledge. Fear is one of the most effective tools used by the Christian “god.” Fear is only effective if there is a lack of knowledge. \r\n\r\nSatan is not \"evil,\" nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. One only needs to look to the Christian bible, to see all of the curses, punishments, and afflictions their so-called \"God\" has inflicted upon humanity. Now here is real abuse of psychic power, and those who do not stop to think are deluded into believing humanity is not worthy of it. Jehova uses black magick to enslave and inflict suffering upon humans and many others. \r\n\r\nSatan has given us modern medicine (whose sign is the serpent), while it is not yet perfect, it has saved many lives and healed billions of people. Satan has given us knowledge that has elevated humanity above that of an animal. All modern conveniences and technology are from Satan as well as spiritual knowledge that give us true power and advance our souls. Satanism stands for the balance of spirituality with technology. Without this balance, civilizations eventually collapse. \r\n\r\n“Hell” is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close to Satan, have seen “Hell.” We all seem to have had the same experiences. Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in other places there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color. I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, [playing cards]. The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. \r\n\r\nSATANIC SACRAMENTS \r\n\r\nWith Christianity, one is expected to give their soul without question. Infants are baptized; children around six years of age are given communion and there are no informed choices. [Little children] say bedtime prayers, asking the Christian \"god\" to take their souls, if they \"die before they wake.\" First of all YOUR SOUL IS YOU and ONLY YOU should have a right to do with it, as YOU see fit. No one should have the right to demand your soul, as have the Christians and their \"god” for centuries. Christians are forever preaching the concept of \"free will,\" but are nothing but a bunch of liars and hypocrites as they are the most aggressive violaters of \"free will\" and always have been, with centuries of resorting to torture and mass murder to coerce people into worshipping their \"god.\" \r\n\r\nThe arrogant Christian god, which is really more than one entity as we can see with the new age movement, (angels are beginning to reveal themselves and their appearance is far different than the white winged beings most people believe they are seeing), in his degrading attitude towards humanity, feels he is entitled. Souls are harvested for energy if deemed fit. \r\n\r\nMany Satanists dedicate their souls to Satan, as I have. There are reasons for this. In truth, the soul we save is our own. Satan guides us and empowers us to advance to a higher spiritual level where we are no longer enslaved with ignorance. Deluded, foolish Christians can pray for us and harass all they want to. In truth, the “saved” campaign is nothing more than another deception and lie. The Nazarene was invented to keep people from saving their own souls. He is and has been nothing more than a distraction to keep humanity from advancing spiritually. Christians are deluded into believing they will be miraculously saved by the Nazarene who was nothing more than a human blood sacrifice for “Jehova”. They are deluded into doing nothing spiritually and most know nothing about their souls. \r\n\r\nWe are under Satan's protection. Satan is very protective of his people. Disciples of Satan don't have to ride around in a bullet proof armored personnel carrier, like the Catholic Pope. Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey and other high profile Satanists have died of natural causes in spite of having a plethora of enemies. \r\n\r\nOnce a commitment is made, Satan begins investing in you. Most Satanists are extremely evolved compared to outsiders. Many non-Satanists are into the occult and are stuck at square one when it comes to [understanding], knowledge, and ability. They often meet with disaster, because they lack the necessary spiritual protection. Jehova and his angels are serious about working to stop humans from advancing. \r\n\r\nAs opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way about blood sacrifice. This is of Jehova and can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The serpent/snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened. We have our own power, and do not need outside sources as does “Jehova” and company.",

    "definition": "(noun) A person that feels no difference between being with other people and alone.\n\n(adjective) Being indifferent to socializing with others.\n\nThey either never feel alone (positive variant), or always feel alone (negative) regardless of whomever is present. Positive ambisocialism normally arises from having grown [up in] constant social contact. And likewise negative ambisocial individuals have grown up spending little to no time with others.\n\nAn ambisocial differs from an antisocial in that social scenarios do not drive negative behavior or change a person's behavior at all.\r\nAmbisocials also differ from an asocial in that the prospect of socializing does not impact their decision of choosing to go to a [social event] or being alone. Ambisocials will neither avoid nor gravitate towards social events.\n\nTo an ambisocial, the [vibration] of their phone means nothing. Either 500 new notifications, or zero, it's [all the same] to them.",

Or tails and she's home watching basketball with a phone in one hand and beer in another. When the game ends at 12 am her eyes close and falls fast asleep.

The recipient in hopes to be \"dipped\" will lie on his or her back, with mouth agape. The bearer will then position himself above the other, sure to have removed all lower garments, and will slowly begin to lower himself being mindful to align his penis and testicles to the target mouth. \r\n\r\nNow keep in mind, the man must remain calm, so as not disrupt the delivery. Things could get \"messy\" if one looses his flaccidity. And as for the recipient, a little help is not frowned upon, a simple guiding hand will surely relieve some of the pressure off of the already anxious performer.  \r\n\r\nOkay, now lets get down to business;  the completion. Once you are properly aligned, it is now safe to initiate drop sequence. It is completely up to the dipper how much force is used when entering the said mouth.

Since the 1970s, video recordings on VCR tapes and later, digital playback systems such as DVDs, have enabled the television to be used to view recorded movies and other programs.\r\n\r\nA television system may be made up of multiple components, so a screen which lacks an internal tuner to receive the broadcast signals is called a monitor rather than a television.

    "definition": "Juggaloism is a religion that the [Insane Clown Posse] introduced to the world in 1992 with the first Joker's Card: The Carnival of Carnage. Since then there have been many more advances on to the Juggalo community of believers, and five more Joker's Cards: The Ringmaster, The Riddlebox, [The Great Milenko], [The Amazing Jeckel Brothers] and the Shangri-la (heaven) and Hell's pit version of the last Joker's Card The Wraith.\r\n\r\nMany people see the people see the Dark Carnival as evil because of the things they see about it. But to think so is ignorance. The Carnival is a supernatural caravan of dead Juggalos and Juggalettes and spirits of the Carnival traveling the [Earth to] pick up the departed, evil or holy. \r\n\r\nThe Carnival unlike the Devil or God , all they do is judge the purity of your soul, and take you to heaven or hell. Juggalos stay behind with the carnival because in at the [end of the world]: The Tempest, they will fight in the battle of Armageddon. That is why it is appropriate for Juggalos to be called ninjas, because that it what they are. \r\n\r\nThe Tempest is the [end of the world]. It is the same thing as The bible book: Revelations, but it is described as a great storm, and in the Juggalo faith, it is believed to be happening very soon.\r\n\r\nICP's music reflects everything about this religion very figuratively, and befor the Sixth Joker's Card, kind of secretly. They did this because they wanted to draw in people who were lost from God's word, and who had the spirit to go find more about the Dark Carnival. You are not a true Juggalo unless you believe in God. ICP's music is all entertainment, but if you look farther into it, they are only talking about killing wicked people. I know they aren't going out and killing sinners, because they mean this also figuratively. Killing the wicked is merely a metaphor for killing the wicked inside of people. \r\n\r\nThe Dark Carnival is very related to Christianity, but in a modern way. Juggalo's cus because they beleive that over time, the weight of a sin has changed, small sins like cussing and stuff like that, are not as important as bigotry or murder. Many don't think ICP's music is Christian, but it is. One example is on the Shangri-la cd. On many of the back tracks it said things about Jesus being our savior.",

When they park their BMW's that their parents gave them as a coming home present from their mission they generally take up 3 parking spots. Typical conversations with his All Star Bro's will generally include one of three topics: Their workouts, muscles, and how many chicks they have hooked up with. These conversations tend to be as loud as possible and in front of as many girls as possible.

The Tenderloin has  historically been the gateway to more [affordable housing] for immigrants and other downtrodden types, but typically is a haven for the dispossessed.  The origin of the name \"Tenderloin\" stems from the graft collected by the vice squad who patrolled the area, and who were thus able to buy the choicest cuts of beef.  There are many other ideas for why the neighborhood was given this peculiar moniker, but regardless of the explanation they invariably tend to emphasize the neighborhood's seediness and depravity.  Supposedly the neighborhood today is undergoing gentrification, but tell that to the crack dealers [on the corner] and they'll give you a befuddled look because they're mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants from South and Central American countries.  But organizations--like rental kingpins Skyline Realty and their subsidiary Citiapartments--are attempting to \"improve\" the Tenderloin by buying out old apartment buildings, driving out the tenants, and raising the rents astronomically so that only people who can afford pure uncut cocaine can live in them.  If this trend persists then the Tenderloin's boundaries may eventually contract to those 10 blocks that radiate from Market street and include St. Anthony's, Boedekker Park, Chez Paree, and the public toilet across from the New Century.

    "definition": "Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance: The [Lighthouse] of Alexandria. For sailors, it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor. For architects, it meant even more: it was the tallest building on Earth. And for scientists, it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km (35 miles) off-shore. \r\n\r\nLocation\r\nOn the ancient island of Pharos, now a promontory within the city of Alexandria in Egypt. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nShortly after the death of [Alexander the Great], his commander Ptolemy Soter assumed power in Egypt. He had witnessed the founding of Alexandria, and established his capital there. Off of the city's coast lies a small island: Pharos. Its name, legend says, is a variation of Pharaoh's Island, but it is more likely that the name is Greek in origin. The island was connected to the mainland by means of a dike - the Heptastadion - which gave the city a double harbor. And because of dangerous sailing conditions and flat coastline in the region, the [construction] of a [lighthouse] was necessary. \r\n\r\nThe project was conceived and initiated by Ptolemy Soter around 290 BC, but was completed after his death, during the reign of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus. Sostratus, a [contemporary] of Euclid, was the architect, but detailed calculations for the structure and its accessories were carried out at the Alexandria Library/Mouseion. The monument was dedicated to the Savior Gods: Ptolemy Soter (lit. savior) and his wife Berenice. For centuries, the [Lighthouse] of Alexandria (occasionally referred to as the Pharos [Lighthouse]) was used to mark the harbor, using fire at night and reflecting sun rays during the day. It was even shown on Roman coins, just as famous monuments are depicted on currency today. \r\n\r\nWhen the Arabs conquered Egypt, they admired Alexandria and its wealth. The Lighthouse continues to be mentioned in their writings and travelers accounts. But the new rulers moved their capital to Cairo since they had no ties to the Mediterranean. When the mirror was brought down mistakenly, they did not restore it back into place. In AD 956, an earthquake shook Alexandria, and caused little damage to the Lighthouse. It was later in 1303 and in 1323 that two stronger earthquakes left a [significant] [impression] on the structure. When the famous Arab traveler Ibn Battuta visited Alexandria in 1349, he could not enter the ruinous monument or even climb to its doorway. \r\n\r\n[The final chapter] in the history of the Lighthouse came in AD 1480 when the Egyptian Mamelouk Sultan, Qaitbay, decided to fortify Alexandria's defense. He built a medieval fort on the same spot where the Lighthouse once stood, using the fallen stone and marble. \r\n\r\n[Description]\r\nOf the six vanished Wonders, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was the last to disappear. Therefore we have adequately accurate knowledge of its location and appearance. Ancient accounts such as those by Strabo and Pliny the Elder give us a brief [description] of the \"tower\" and the magnificent [white marble] cover. They tell us how the mysterious mirror could reflect the light tens of kilometers away. Legend says the mirror was also used to detect and burn enemy ships before they could reach the shore. \r\n\r\nIn 1166, an Arab traveler, Abou-Haggag Al-Andaloussi visited the Lighthouse. He documented a wealth of [information] and gave an accurate [description] of the structure which helped modern archeologists reconstruct the monument. It was composed of three stages: The lowest square, 55.9 m (183.4 ft) high with a cylindrical core; the middle octagonal with a side length of 18.30 m (60.0 ft) and a height of 27.45 m (90.1 ft); and the third circular 7.30 m (24.0 ft) high. The total height of the building including the foundation base was about 117 m (384 ft), equivalent to a 40-story modern building. The internal core was used as a shaft to lift the fuel needed for the fire. At the top stage, the mirror reflected sunlight during the day while fire was used during the night. In ancient times, a statue of Poseidon adorned the summit of the building. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Lighthouse of Alexandria did not survive to the present day, it left its influence in various respects. From an architectural standpoint, the monument has been used as a model for many prototypes along the Mediterranean, as far away as Spain. And from a linguistic standpoint, it gave its name -- Pharos -- to all the lighthouses in the world... Just look up the dictionary for the French, Italian, or Spanish word for lighthouse.",

Upon settling in areas around the Black Sea, they encountered the Roman Empire, and in the fourth century AD, sacked the city, putting the nail [in the coffin] for the mighty empire, and that was the end of that.\r\n\r\n2. Short for 'gothic,' a musical and stylistic movement that came off the punk scene in the late 1970s with such bands as Bauhaus and Siouxsie and the Banshees.  Popularity has waxed and waned since but the movement has remained intact to this day.  Probably [one of the most] visually distinct subcultures around, characterized by a preference for dark clothing that is often influenced by Victorian, medieval and BDSM ascetics, among other things, and/or make-up, a pale complexion and some pretty [interesting] footwear.  Since events like Columbine that sparked a witch hunt, goth culture has been accused of corrupting minors with Satanism, vampirism and violence.  In truth, a great number of goths are actually [intelligent], articulate and conscious people who, despite the foreboding appearance, are [for the most part], more stimulating to be around than any of the varieties of chickenshit conformist that dominate the world today.\r\n\r\n3. An angsty, angry suburban teenager who needs a great way to rebel against his or her unfair parents.  What better way than with a Marilyn Manson t-shirt, a terrible black hair dye job and matching lipstick?  Claiming to be 'gothic' because they listen to angry nu-metal bands like Slipknot and Korn, they often think their issues like drugs and self-mutilation contribute to their gawthick-ness.  They will probably grow out of it in a few months and find something new to piss of their parents with.  Until then, they'll just give the rest of us a bad name.",

Other bands such as Aggression, Death, [Necrophagia], Nun Slaughter, Slaughter Lord and even Slayer contributed to the movement.  What defined death metal was the fact that it was basically an [exaggerated] form of thrash--everything from the vocals (which transformed into a mix of growling, grunting and rasping) to the drumming was made harsher and heavier than before.  The music itself became somewhat anti-rhythmic, and in some cases [experimental] (as seen with Darkthrone's Goatlord album, or the modern technicality of [Necrophagist]).  The first bands to really modernize the movement included Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse, the virtually unkown Necrovore, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Ripping Corpse, among others.  Death metal could range from the blood and gore horror imagery of Cannibal Corpse, to the satanic overtones of Deicide, to the political statements carried by Dying Fetus.  Some criticize death metal as they feel the musicians do nothing but randomly band their instruments.  Nothing could be further from the truth--listen to Morbid Angel's album Covenant, for instance, or Cannibal Corpse's Gore Obsessed, to get a better [perspective] on the scene.",

Duvall is a bit [off the beaten path], and has a tendency to become an island in the winter since the city lies in a floodplain, and has only one main access road.\n\nThe busier downtown areas are built on the hillside, where flooding is less likely (*but still possible, I've seen water on main street before*), and the river basin is populated mainly by farmers. The city of Duvall has made many efforts to improve flood conditions. Woodinville-Duvall Rd. was rebuilt after the terrible flood of 2006, when most of the residents of Duvall were housebound (or shelter-bound) and without power and other services for two weeks. The rebuild of the road included a much higher bridge, however, you still have to cross the valley to leave town. The city of Duvall is surrounded by rivers on three sides, The Snohomish, The Skykomish, and the Snoqulamie. Generally, when any portion of the river system floods here, it floods the entire basin. This includes Duvall and the [neighboring] towns of Monroe, Carnation, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. The valley in Duvall is quite expansive, and when it floods, it looks like an unimaginable amount of water as it devours the entire valley. Sometimes seagulls show up to prey on the fish (I'm guessing [that's why] they're there).\n\nDuvall is known for being a safe place that is \"out there\". A cursory glance at a map will show you that the area is, indeed, pretty isolated. This town is one of the few remaining that towns that you could sleep with all your doors unlocked and your car open with the key in the ignition, not that I'd recommend that anywhere. Duvall is home to many local farms, and has a surprising number of (family-oriented) [recreational] activities considering the size of the town.\n\nThe landscape is lush and green. The valley is open (that's the floodplain) and the hills are heavily forested in a way that only [western Washington] can offer.",

Smarties are from England and simply have a production plant in Canada (as well as Germany and several other countries)\r\n\r\n2. Given\r\n\r\n3. Given\r\n\r\n4. The original \"Rules of Baseball\" was written by Alexander Cartwright, a New Yorker, and the origins of pre-baseball games are said to be from England.  I think you mean that \"Baseball is played in Canada.\"\r\n\r\n5. Sort-of, but I'll give you this one too. Lacrosse was an iriqois game first witnessed by westerners by a Frenchman back when we were both part of the British empire.\r\n\r\n6. Absolutely\r\n\r\n7. I guess... James Naismith was indeed Canadian, but this all happened in [Massachusetts].\r\n\r\n8. Apple pie has been eaten since before the New World was even discovered, recipies date back to the 1300s...\r\n\r\n9. Given\r\n\r\n10. Given, though [Dunkin' Donuts] is garbade.  TH coffee is garbage too, but the food is much better IMO\r\n\r\n11.  [The war of 1812] was before Canada WAS Canada, it was the UK vs the US, period.  The US DECLARED war (but certainly did not start it) because of the UK FORCING americans to serve in their royal navy. It was more or less a second war for [independence] and ended with a treaty.\r\n\r\n12. You guys better keep appeasing all of Quebec's demands so they will stop threatening to leave your union.\r\n\r\n13. Canada has never played anything more than a supporting role in any war, ever. There is no reason to surrender when you've never fought an actual war on your own.\r\n\r\n14. Your civil war is coming [in the near future] if your [rediculous] appeasing, ass-kissing [politicians] fail to keep Quebec from seceding.\r\n\r\n15. okie\r\n\r\n16.

Not really anything worth bragging about, did this just happen in Canada?  \r\n\r\n21. Snowmobiles were indeed invented by a canadian, jet-skis were invented by an Arizonan, Velcro was invented in Switzerland, Insulin is found natuarally in the human body, but was discovered by a German, and was first USED AS A MEDICINE in Canada. Penecillin was discovered by a Scottish scientist, Zambonis were invented by an American, in America..... Oh and Alexander [Graham Bell] was Scottish too.  Are you just naming random things and saying they're Canadian? This is really [rediculous], lol!\r\n\r\n22. Given.\r\n\r\n23.  Superman was invented by an American AND a Canadian in America.\r\n\r\n24. True.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems from this that one could just make random claims in Canada and people would just completely take it for fact, without any bit of skepticism, lol. Do you guys usually confuse yourselves with [Great Britain]? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being out of the way, I love Canada! I love Canadians! I haven't met many Canadian assholes at all.  From my point of view, Canada and the US (Canadians and Americans) are much more similar places than some people on either sides of the border seem to believe.
