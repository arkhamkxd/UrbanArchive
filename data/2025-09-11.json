It came from the Old French word gai, and arrived in English during the 12th century.\n\nIV. These days 'gay' is, wrongly, used to refer to something (namely an [inanimate object], for example a bag) that is unfavourable. Synonyms of this sort include 'sad' and 'lame'. They are all wrong, because an inanimatr object, such as a bag, presumably do not have feelings (sorry, bags, if you do) and therefore they cannot be sad, and this is a ridiculously derived insult. Bags do not have legs either, and thus they cannot be lame. But the supposed 'insult' of 'gay' annoys me most. Firstly because an [inanimate object], such as a bag, cannot really be attracted to other things of the same sex. According to humans, as we made them, they do not have genders of their own.\n\nOffensive, rude, and not-to-be-used 'synonyms' include faggot, fag and [queer], the latter not being as bad and commonly used by gays themselves - but there are many more worse ones. For lesbians there is dyke, lez and lezzer, but there are probably far worse for these too.\n\nA woman or girl who has many gay male friends is sometimes known as a fag hag.\n\nGay is not an insult.\n\nI love gay people.",
    "example": "I. Two gay men live happily up the road. :)\n\nII. The gays said they were going clubbing.\n\nIII. We'll have a gay old time.\r\nHe felt light and gay, and began to dance for joy.\n\nIV. Omg dat's like so gay innit. Faggooot. :(\n\n--\n\n\"Gay is not an insult.\"\n\n\"I love gay people.\"\n\n--\n\nCain - \"[I just had sex] with Marcus.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Good grief, Cain, that makes you gay!\"\n\nCain - \"Hell it does, lad.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Well [I like you] no less. In fact I like you more.\"\n\n[This is good].",

The myth of the giant burnso was originated from early 1400's, where a seafarer traveling to seek land first came across the giant burnso. After the capsized vessel was found floating on shore, the sea man was found in the boat truly scared to death, his eyes wide open, only no words were ever to be spoken from him again. On a note they found the words \"it was the giant burnso\". After days passed he finally spoke of his tragic meeting with this creature, his voice shaky he described that once he looked into the cold eyes of the burnso, he went numb. He heard a horrific screeching come from the beast, all he could make out from the screams was the words \"burnso, giant burnso\". Finally the creature picked up the man, and the way he described it was he felt like the creature was actually sucking the life from his mouth. His body than went limp, and the creature disappeared. Other stories have been similar to that of the sea mans tragic meeting, only the others all describe the colors of the burnso as [everything but] pink, some say a [yellow tail], with a gian [brown beard], while others only say they saw green.

While this may seem disorganized, it is a much more [efficient] way of running a board than enforcing stringent rules, which can be seen on Tinychan's archenemy, AnonTalk's board.\n\nTinychan has a number of helpful mods who are all very welcoming and enjoy a hearty chuckle (especially if it's at the expense of Kimmo Alm, the SysOp of Anontalk).",

I wish I could find another anonymous board which doesn't have those nasty [pedophiles] or those fucked up rules.\r\nNatasha: Have you tried Tinychan?

She likes people to know that she will not tolerate that. Anusha might love to diss everyone in her path. This is not necessarily a good thing but it can be quite entertaining tbh.",

    "definition": "MOBA ([Multiplayer] Online Battle Arena) is a new gaming genre. Spawned from early forums from the custom map for Starcraft called {Aeon of Strife} and Evolved in to the most recent Defense of the Ancients or \"DotA\". The [objective] of the MOBA Genre is for each team to destroy the opponents' Base, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players [use] powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters called \"creeps\". As in role-playing games, players level up their hero and use gold to buy equipment during [the mission].\n\nEach human player must control one Hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In DotA-Allstars, players on each side choose one of ninety-five heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. Nevertheless, some heroes, given enough time, can change the outcome single-handedly, while [countering] the opposing team's heroes.\n\nBecause the game play revolves around strengthening [individual] heroes, it does not require one to focus on resource management and base-building, as in most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player [experience points]; when enough experience is accumulated, the player gains a level. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage it can inflict, and allows players to upgrade their spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource, in most cases: gold.\n\nThe typical resource gathering is based on a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities. Certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an [important] tactical element of the scenario.\n\nMost MOBA Games offer a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match. The game modes dictate the [difficulty] of the scenario, as well as whether people can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined (for example, an easy [difficulty] level and a random hero pick), allowing more flexible options.",

A punch bullet will go through a moose, a bear, or a bison from end to end. It will just as easily go through 11 or 12 Bloods.

The music is choppy, bassy and almost always distorted to some degree with different types of vocals, mostly male, which tend to blend and harmonize with the music.  The guitars are often tuned to D or open D to get that low sound of metal-like distortion that the standard E tuning doesn't offer.  The term \"stoner rock\" most likely comes from the perceived [association] of smoking marijuana and the fans of this music.  However, smoking marijuana is not necessary to enjoy the music.  These are some of the bands considered to be stoner rock:  T-Rex, Kyuss, [Monster Magnet], Wolfmother, Black Sabbath, Fu Manchu, QOTSA.",
    "example": "Stoner Rock is fun to play on [the guitar] because of its [simplicity] in basic form; playing it is as simple as tuning the low E of your guitar down to D, then play the low D, A and D strings (the top three) open.  From there, you can hit the 3rd fret and noodle the 5th fret on the same three strings - start playing this, while allowing the open strings to resonate between strums on the 3rd and 5th frets - you're playing the [beginnings] of Stoner Rock!",
