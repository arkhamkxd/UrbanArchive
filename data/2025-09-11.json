It came from the Old French word gai, and arrived in English during the 12th century.\n\nIV. These days 'gay' is, wrongly, used to refer to something (namely an [inanimate object], for example a bag) that is unfavourable. Synonyms of this sort include 'sad' and 'lame'. They are all wrong, because an inanimatr object, such as a bag, presumably do not have feelings (sorry, bags, if you do) and therefore they cannot be sad, and this is a ridiculously derived insult. Bags do not have legs either, and thus they cannot be lame. But the supposed 'insult' of 'gay' annoys me most. Firstly because an [inanimate object], such as a bag, cannot really be attracted to other things of the same sex. According to humans, as we made them, they do not have genders of their own.\n\nOffensive, rude, and not-to-be-used 'synonyms' include faggot, fag and [queer], the latter not being as bad and commonly used by gays themselves - but there are many more worse ones. For lesbians there is dyke, lez and lezzer, but there are probably far worse for these too.\n\nA woman or girl who has many gay male friends is sometimes known as a fag hag.\n\nGay is not an insult.\n\nI love gay people.",
    "example": "I. Two gay men live happily up the road. :)\n\nII. The gays said they were going clubbing.\n\nIII. We'll have a gay old time.\r\nHe felt light and gay, and began to dance for joy.\n\nIV. Omg dat's like so gay innit. Faggooot. :(\n\n--\n\n\"Gay is not an insult.\"\n\n\"I love gay people.\"\n\n--\n\nCain - \"[I just had sex] with Marcus.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Good grief, Cain, that makes you gay!\"\n\nCain - \"Hell it does, lad.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Well [I like you] no less. In fact I like you more.\"\n\n[This is good].",

The myth of the giant burnso was originated from early 1400's, where a seafarer traveling to seek land first came across the giant burnso. After the capsized vessel was found floating on shore, the sea man was found in the boat truly scared to death, his eyes wide open, only no words were ever to be spoken from him again. On a note they found the words \"it was the giant burnso\". After days passed he finally spoke of his tragic meeting with this creature, his voice shaky he described that once he looked into the cold eyes of the burnso, he went numb. He heard a horrific screeching come from the beast, all he could make out from the screams was the words \"burnso, giant burnso\". Finally the creature picked up the man, and the way he described it was he felt like the creature was actually sucking the life from his mouth. His body than went limp, and the creature disappeared. Other stories have been similar to that of the sea mans tragic meeting, only the others all describe the colors of the burnso as [everything but] pink, some say a [yellow tail], with a gian [brown beard], while others only say they saw green.

While this may seem disorganized, it is a much more [efficient] way of running a board than enforcing stringent rules, which can be seen on Tinychan's archenemy, AnonTalk's board.\n\nTinychan has a number of helpful mods who are all very welcoming and enjoy a hearty chuckle (especially if it's at the expense of Kimmo Alm, the SysOp of Anontalk).",

    "definition": "MOBA ([Multiplayer] Online Battle Arena) is a new gaming genre. Spawned from early forums from the custom map for Starcraft called {Aeon of Strife} and Evolved in to the most recent Defense of the Ancients or \"DotA\". The [objective] of the MOBA Genre is for each team to destroy the opponents' Base, heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players [use] powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters called \"creeps\". As in role-playing games, players level up their hero and use gold to buy equipment during [the mission].\n\nEach human player must control one Hero, a powerful unit with unique abilities. In DotA-Allstars, players on each side choose one of ninety-five heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; it is difficult for one player to carry the team to victory alone. Nevertheless, some heroes, given enough time, can change the outcome single-handedly, while [countering] the opposing team's heroes.\n\nBecause the game play revolves around strengthening [individual] heroes, it does not require one to focus on resource management and base-building, as in most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player [experience points]; when enough experience is accumulated, the player gains a level. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage it can inflict, and allows players to upgrade their spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource, in most cases: gold.\n\nThe typical resource gathering is based on a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing hostile units, base structures, and enemy heroes. Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities. Certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an [important] tactical element of the scenario.\n\nMost MOBA Games offer a variety of game modes, selected by the game host at the beginning of the match. The game modes dictate the [difficulty] of the scenario, as well as whether people can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined (for example, an easy [difficulty] level and a random hero pick), allowing more flexible options.",

A punch bullet will go through a moose, a bear, or a bison from end to end. It will just as easily go through 11 or 12 Bloods.

The music is choppy, bassy and almost always distorted to some degree with different types of vocals, mostly male, which tend to blend and harmonize with the music.  The guitars are often tuned to D or open D to get that low sound of metal-like distortion that the standard E tuning doesn't offer.  The term \"stoner rock\" most likely comes from the perceived [association] of smoking marijuana and the fans of this music.  However, smoking marijuana is not necessary to enjoy the music.  These are some of the bands considered to be stoner rock:  T-Rex, Kyuss, [Monster Magnet], Wolfmother, Black Sabbath, Fu Manchu, QOTSA.",
    "example": "Stoner Rock is fun to play on [the guitar] because of its [simplicity] in basic form; playing it is as simple as tuning the low E of your guitar down to D, then play the low D, A and D strings (the top three) open.  From there, you can hit the 3rd fret and noodle the 5th fret on the same three strings - start playing this, while allowing the open strings to resonate between strums on the 3rd and 5th frets - you're playing the [beginnings] of Stoner Rock!",

    "definition": "The Kerry detractor comments are TERRIFYING.  Having just graduated from an great prep school I was lucky to be able to attend and finished two consecutive intensive US History and [political science] courses, these comments seem lifted straight out of everything from the Salem Witch trials to Orwell's 1984.  \r\nSomeone said that Kerry is wealthier than Bush,  and therefore could not legislate in any way benefiting the indigent.  This seems almost too ridiculous to be sincere, but factually, all you need to do is look up pending legislation before the Senate Subcomittee on Finance and you'll see a bill Kerry has written this year called the Kids First Act which provides healthcare for children who fall below Medicaid and SCHIP cutoffs by rolling back Bush's taxcuts for people who make over 300, 000 dollars a year.  \r\nErica says that there are [weapons of mass destruction] in Iraq.  Even George W admits that there aren't.  You've gotta stop watching so much Fox News, Erica, but it's not just you-- 46 percent of Fox viewers believe that there is a direct link between Iraq and Al-Queda, as compared to only 9 percent of PBS viewers.  Also, [I don't know] where you learned US Government and Policy, but obviously Senators do not have the authority to issue purple hearts to themselves or anyone else.\r\nI'd love Boekenoogen to get back to me about Kerry receiving purple hearts for \"splinters\" when he gets back from a tour of duty in, say, Tel Aviv, gets shot at by insurgents, and saves a fellow soldiers life.  It's not an opinion but a fact that Kerry saved a soldier’s life in the Mekong Delta under fire; his military records were released about a month ago.  Yes, he should have released them during the campaign, but he didn't want to kowtow to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth who were OFFICIALLY, FACTUALLY LYING.  I agree he was a poor campaigner, but didn't think it would take much to see the character and dignity behind a non-response.  \r\nThe number of homophobic slurs made by Kerry's detractors speaks for itself.\r\nKerry does have higher education; he has a JD from BC.\r\nFor all the people who said Kerry has no stance on issues, briefly they are (as per [the New York Times], the Atlantic, [the New Yorker], aka not exceptionally obscure pieces of journalism) federally funded adoption of elimination of SCHIP and Medicaid cutoffs in exchange for states providing coverage for those who fall below 300 percent below the poverty level, making Iraq's borders less porous, making use of the tribal, ethnic and religious militias in Iraq like the Kurdish pesh merga by integrating them into a National-Guard esque force that secures specific provinces, leaving gay marriage up to the states, providing more security for America's borders (under Bush, 95 percent of cargo comes in uninspected), putting more cops on [the streets], and paying for it all by rolling back the trillions of dollars in tax cuts Bush has given to the wealthy.\r\nTradesman seems to be blithely oblivious to reality.  He says Kerry isn't a war veteran.  Everyone but Tradesman should obviously see that as incorrect.  His claim that Kerry can know nothing about fighting for the \"little people\" shows complete ignorance of the economic theory and applicability behind Bush and Kerry's respective economic policies.  \r\nMy favorite comment is from John-John.  He calls Kerry, \"as stupid as they come.\"  He also spells the word, \"four\" incorrectly.\r\nI find it [interesting] that some said Democrats are eroding people's basic rights.  [The Patriot Act] was a [Donald Rumsfeld] slice of 1984, [Republicans] in office all over the country have mandated teaching creationism in science classes claiming that all viewpoints must be presented, yet forbidden health classes to educate students on contraception, National Identification Cards are under proposal from a Republican Legislature..... Democrats certainly are not interested in infringing upon the factual rights presented in the Bill of Rights.  \r\nAnyone who thinks Teresa could fund her husbands campaign any more than Carlyle Group could have funded Bush's doesn't know anything about campaign finance law.\r\nSomeone called Teresa a \"numbskull.\"  I have to wonder-- do YOU know seven languages?\r\n[Radical Republican] really did a good job of mocking several other [conservative] posters' excellent point that Democrats do need to stop mocking everyone who doesn't agree with them as illiterate, inbred rednecks, and that political allegiances shouldn't be based on petty character traits.  Mocking Kerry's Boston accent?  He's FROM Boston and mocking someone's [geographical] status completely detracts from the good points made the other [Republicans].  And before he gets too excited about Iraqi elections, RR should also consider that the Vietcong allowed elections in 1967.\r\nI really like Chester though, who seems to really hate Kerry as.... president.  Yep, he actually calls Kerry the president.\r\n\r\nI'll be a freshman at Harvard in the fall, and a main reason I chose the school is because I want to work for Kerry in his Boston office.  What I, an 18-year-old girl, perceive him to be is clearly different from many other Americans.  But my perception is based on extensive questioning my conviction and years of intensive study on the subject of US History and Government.  I pride myself on not forming political allegiances based on which candidate is the most affable to the average American voter, and not writing off a candidate because he seems Brahmin or aloof.  \r\n\r\nJohn Kerry is a true American who knows that ignoring nuance does not make it go away, and that \"When Americans stand up to speak their mind that America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism, it is the heart and soul of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot think of anything more American than that statement.  And to anyone who disagrees with that, I ask you to go back to your [history book] and look up how America freed itself from colonization and became sovereign.  America was BORN of dissent, and from asking the Senate, \"how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\"  to championing dissent in his DNC acceptance speech, nobody understands that more than John Kerry.",

Usually such devices have 1 to 3 orifices with only a little context surrounding the holes. Like just a face, with eyes, nose, and a [fuckable mouth], period. Or some female porn star's crotch, just the crotch, nothing else, no belly, no legs, just 2 holes and maybe some fur. You can see these on the sex toy sites. The less body the more the device is a dongbot. In this respect the penile pump is the ultimate dongbot for males, having no body parts except for a sucking slidy orifice. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, even a blow-up doll is much more than a dongbot. When sailors took blow-up dolls on long voyages, as bunk mates, these life-size dolls may have even become a limited form of lovebot. Look at Tom Hanks and the volleyball. We humans value sex, but we also long for [companionship] and love. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, according to net sources, Japanese sailors used more of a dongbot than a love doll on long voyages. Called a \"Dutch wife\" (they got the idea from the Dutch?), this was like a leather pillow with a hole. The interior of the hole was reportedly lined with silk.\r\n\r\nAs Lenny Bruce once said, men will schtupp anything, even mud.

The LFS buses are available in 40-foot rigid and 62-foot articulated configurations, with the articulated version designed to accommodate higher passenger volumes. The buses feature a fully low-floor design, meaning that the floor is level with the curb, eliminating the need for stairs and making boarding easier for everyone, including passengers in wheelchairs, those with strollers, and the elderly. The series is versatile in terms of propulsion options, available in conventional diesel, compressed [natural gas] (CNG), hybrid diesel-electric, and battery-electric powertrains, catering to different [environmental] and operational needs of transit authorities.",

    "definition": "(also called KAOS or Current 156)\r\na magickal [spirituality] with little or no set-in-stone ritual,dogma,deities, or any other object of faith to which the initiate is bound. The chaos magician only places faith in himself. It is generally agreed among chaos magicians that magick is a process of the psyche, not a nebulous 'spirit' or some such thing. All older magickal paths are seen by chaos initiates as different forms of the same psychic process, which may be imitated with any and all forms of ritual and symbolism that hold a personal meaning for the magician. Gods and ceremonial equipment, if present at all, are seen as symbolic, [psychological] tools used as vehicles into the magician's inner potential. Once this potential is fully realized, the God of use may simply be tossed aside. \r\n\r\nChaos magick finds its origin partially in the 'sigil working' of Austin Osman Spare. In this form of magickal practice, the magician creates a symbol, or sigil, [representing] a goal or desire. Using any method he/she chooses, the magician then goes into a trance state wherein the sigil is the sole object of consciousness. after the climax of this trance state is done with, the sigil is to be \"banished\", or forgotten, so that the goal it represents will ingrain itself into the unconscious mind of the caster.\r\nSome sources have it that the history of chaos magick runs further back. Such sources trace it to the anti-witchcraft hysteria of medieval Christian Europe, in which witches would have to invent new methods of magick so that they would not be caught doing obviously magickal ritual.\r\n\r\nThe first major occultist to write about these ideas calling them 'chaos magick' was Peter Carroll in his books Liber Null and [Psychonaut]. Far-out writer [William S. Burroughs] is also known for his invocation of Arabic gods by chaotic methods. Comic artist Grant Morrisson has also written extensively on the subject. Phil Hine's chaotic path revering Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and other gods from the Lovecraftian mythos has become widely popular, almost to the point of becoming a traditional path in itself. \r\n\r\nEven chaotic magick has its own organizations. The most popular one is called the Illuminates of Thanateros. The dual nature of their god (eros,love and life+Thanatos, death and the will to die) brings to mind the Gnostic yin-yang-ish deity Abrasax. \r\nThee Temple ov Psychick Youth, a splinter group led by artist, musical pioneer, cultural engineer, and \"pandrogyne\" Genesis P-Orridge, places a high emphasis on sigil work focused on the liberation of the [individual] from conditioned modes of thought, as well as bringing about a world of [absolutely free] artistic expression. They show a strong [preference] for [masturbation] as sigil work, and hold both the male and female ejaculants as sacred. The Church of the Subgenius, which deifies Bob the used car dealer, puts out [sarcastically] toned texts and seems to be focused on pranks.",

That's also true in any formal radio telephone procedure such as in police RT where they're not used together. In aviation use neither roger nor wilco are even used much as [individual] words. The full meaning of roger is 'Your last message is received and understood' and it's origin indeed as stated by schizzy is the original phonetic alphabet use of roger for the letter 'R' to 1951now romeo . The full meaning of 'wilco' is 'Your last message is received and [understood] AND wilL BE coMPLIED WITH'. Therefore wilco already includes roger.\n\nHowever, this being [Urban Dictionary] it's the slang/colloquial use being defined so in that setting schizzy's example of the wife/husband is correct whether speaking directly or by phone. It'd also be very acceptable if they were using CB radio I guess. It's slang use can even have slightly sarcastic or facetious overtones at times. However, having an aviation background I reject his example of the pilot and ATC. Redundancy is the lesser sin, no pilot should answer like that. It's required to repeat the instruction back to the controller. The instruction wouldn't be given verbatim as quoted anyway. In aviation, the use of roger to acknowledge [information] no [instructions] may be acceptable at times but wilco is rarely used if at all. Mostly where roger could be used it's sufficient to simply answer with the aircraft's call sign.",

It would have been frowned upon and the person, not of [African American] orgin, would have probably been assulted for ever saying the word.\n\nCurrently you may hear lots of different ethnicities using the word as the word has transended into a hip way of [communicating] within the, \"new generation\".",

    "definition": "Pentamournesty: To be pentamournest as in not to be with just a one partner to be loved in this lifetime.\n\nWhere citizens all pair into romantic couples like one another, a man & woman enjoying one another's company might discuss courting, though he struggles to tell whether a woman's [interested] in him, or in which mood of hers, whether relaxed or vamped up he ought to broach it with her. To whichever one man she agrees to allow share her life, this one or [another more] her type, well upon their telling her they like her, & her saying she likes him too, & his inviting her to be his partner, her saying [yes], even though heard to fall in love would be exciting, she finds it daunting the idea of becoming a one man's spouse, his of his own should she desire a man's love. She smiles trustingly, sure that for all the [white goods] & tech equipment you make & the looking at the stars the do ..for her being his he'll be [doing the math] for the two, each his own canary bird in the mine. They will tell she's in the same condition as last seen her, & she'll be able to tell if there's anything wrong with any of them by the wobble in the others.\r\nWe say that men have a higher [infidelity] rate. That is not to protect women's honour by not saying \"women take more men off of women than men do women off of men\". Not saying this, most are oblivious to that the toxic doesn't blend in with us by their looking like us. They do it by our looking like them.",
    "example": "\"Pentamournesty became an [alternative] family dynamic when in [2022] Charles Darwin's [understanding] on male human sexuality was debunked. Knowing it's not the less but the more women a man sees that makes him more sexually prominent, pentamournesty makes sense to a woman of that when a man's attached, he's more not less [attractive] to other women. We've learnt\r\nwomen are able to sniff whether a man is married or attached. It's not to take the single fellow. What a woman seeks in a man is his being popular. When a man's not popular he's liable to love her how someone agreed with too much loves a person to their own devices. Looksism hides this.\"\n\n\"Pentamournesty an option, a woman might now opt to visit & adore a set long-term 3-5 seperate men, neither herself bound to any, or any to her, & seeing these infrequently they tell her condition like each a canary in the mine. There'll be no marriage plebiscite. Pentamournesty is [voluntary].\"\n\n\"Pentamournesty inspires the incel, the involuntarily celibate male, to declare we ought not call women who see 3-4 any of all the dozens of names that mean erotic [entertainer] anymore, which one said one after the other means to a woman & what children she has, something much worse no one can prove someone had said. Those words, used passively aggressively to sneakily mean more than what said, obstruct pentamournesty from being a fair option offered women.\"",

Germany was taking over Europe, bit by bit.  The had ALL of Europe basically in their grip (along with Italy and their gang) except for the few neutral countries (who they marched right through anyway) and [Great Britain], which [eventually] had no choice but to just sit and defend itself because it was vulnerable from every direction.  While city after city in England and Scotland was demolished, while thousands upon thousands of British citizens were blown to bits, burnt to death, or smothered, Americans said, 'nah, we'll wait thanks.  But here's some bombs - you can pay us later.\"  Finally when Roosevelt realized there was no choice but to enter the war (because the world was basically in shock that one of the only surviving superpowers, besides England, was sitting on their hands while the world was being taken over by three men) - he made sure that a big \"event\" would happen to throw American sentiment across the sea.  So we had [Pearl Harbor], and then all those fresh, well fed American soldiers took off to join the parched, injured, half-starved Allies.\r\n\r\nNow cut to 2001.  America gets attacked by an extremist group - not a government - and 3000 people tragically die.  Bush decided to blame it on Iraq, as an impetus to bring them down for trying to assinate his fire (and because Iraq sits on a huge buttload of oil.)  So when Bush cries out to the rest of the world to try to start [World War III], a lot of countries, well, sat on THEIR hands.  They remembered the millions of dead  family members.  They could still see the effects of the horrible bombing blitzes of [World War II].  They had seen TENS of thousands of civilians die in one night, or over a week, and just have to cope.

This rubbing action ('humping') allows for the participants to experience some degree of friction while engaging in this activity. At first, the friction is considered to be a pleasurable feeling.  After a while, however, irritation can occur.  Why you ask?  Because this whole thing takes place while their clothes are on!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Which, by the way, leads to one of two outcomes: \r\n1)  An abrupt halt to the dry humping, which usually is caused by an extended amount of skin irritation\r\nor\r\n2)  Full on wild animal kingdom SEX TIME (considered to be way more fun than option 1)",
