Usually it isn't found in really thin women (usually you just see their actual spine) nor heavyset women (whose backs are usually just doughey and flat). Most men, consciously or not, find this part of the body sexy.\r\n\r\nThe reason this area is called a Cum Trough is because when engaging in [doggy style] sex or a facsimile thereof, the man may be so inclined to pull out of the woman and [ejaculate] on her mid back. Rather than just leaking every which way, the Cum Trough acts as a trench or trough of sorts and causes all the semen to stay in a neat straight line on the woman's back, presumably until she stands up/rolls to either side.",

    "word": "scouser",
    "definition": "Scousers are an [interesting] result of the [industrial revolution] and Liverpool is a true immigrant city equalled only with London, New York and Buenos Aires. Most Scousers are of Irish and Welsh descent though the city has long standing Chinese, West African and Scandinavian communities with the term 'Scouser' coming from the dish 'Lobscouse' which is a bastardization of the Norwegian word 'labskaus' which is a Norwegian lamb/mutton stew.\r\n\r\nI have read a lot of the enteries on here and knowing the city and a lot of the people I feel I can make a decent unbiased job of writing a fair review about Liverpool.\r\n\r\nScousers are famous for the [sense of humour], though they can laugh at others and do so regulary, they cannot laugh at themselves, any joke about Liverpool is taken as a great insult, Scousers tend to have a [victimized]/martyrdom complex but despite this they are capable of great acts of charity and benevolence. Scousers more often than not employ a disarming but [superficial] friendliness to strangers - it is only when you get to know a Scouser that they start to grate.\r\n\r\nScousers have a 'big man' complex, most Scousers are not physically big nor physically hard though they are able to intimdate people through shouting at them with a guttural accent that has changed a lot in the past 30 years so they can sound more tough. Scousers can be violent and aggresive but the vast majority cannot fight to save their life - another paradox of [this is that] Liverpool is a famous amateur boxing city and has produced many fighters in the lighter weight divsions though never a really good big man and they never will due to the typical Scousers puny physique.\r\n\r\nThe 'Big Man' complex is more apparent in the workplace, Scousers as a rule loath to work but when forced to put in a days graft, Scousers all want to be the boss - 99.9% of them aren't capable of bossing a lemming over the cliff but their attitude to earning a honest living means they aren't receptive to working 8 hours a day under the orders of someone else - strikes and [industrial action] is still common in Liverpool even in these fraught times - Scousers therefore like to go into small business such as [window cleaning] and market stall trading and the shadier ones go into petty crime such as burgulary, drug dealing etc.\r\n\r\nLiverpool is a great city in many ways that has inspired great artists,\r\nwriters, poets and musicians and is [one of the most] aestheically beautiful architectural cities in the world - however Scousers have a [love hate relationship] with Manchester - a horrid shit tip 30 miles away - It is lost on the majority of Scousers that the Mancunian is the most closest thing to a Scouser you can get in look, attitude and lifestyle. Scousers are nothing like Geordies or Glaswegians like they purport to be, but the Scouser and the Mancunian is an near identical animal.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you will never ever hear a Scouser saying is 'Oh! I never/didn't know that?' Scousers know [everything] about anything. A Scouser will never admit to not knowing about any subject on planet earth and is quite capable of telling a [brain surgeon] how to do thier job despite the fact the Scouser in question might be a milkman or a doley or something equally as tragic.\r\n\r\nScousers have a highly developed and protective sense of self, they are proud to be born in the city and any 'Texan' 'Plazzy' or 'Wool' who claims to be [one of them] is going to get the heave ho before long, they are not tolerant of non Scousers claiming to be Scousers. \r\n\r\nEven the good people of Birkenhead, Kirkby, Huyton and Skem are seen as 'plazzies' even though the rest of the planet see them as Scousers. It is a complex state of affairs. (If you are from Skem that is!)\r\n\r\nThe true Scouse accent is Celtic in origin, it is a mixture of Welsh, Irish and Lancastrian dialects, the lilting sounds of John Lennon have now been replaced by the rasping, guttural sound\r\nof the Scouser of today - apparentley \r\nTVs Eastenders is the biggest influence in the change of the accent over the past 30 years!\r\n\r\nLiverpool has a higher ratio of beautiful women than in other parts of the UK down to the high racial mixing \r\nof the populace - its is not uncommon for your bog standard Scouser to have a \r\nSomalian/Paraguayan/Egypt ian/Burmese etc grandparent or great grandparent which leads to attractive women - though their attractivness is negated by their big mouths and bad attitudes - mind you\r\nthey have been dealing with their male [counterparts] since birth so I can [understand] it but I wouldn't want any part of it!\r\n\r\nI could do a piece about the football but a) It has been covered ad nauseum and b) I would have to mention Heysel and the pre 1989 'Munich 58' song.",

The original definition of \"Nerp\" was an acronym which meant \"Never Eat Rice Pudding.\" It meant that there was \"NERP on top of a chicken, or chicken on top of NERP.\" Nerp was therefore occasionally an unknown substance which could be alternately underneath or on top of a (live) chicken. There were variations among the original users, such as \"NERPing\" which roughly meant \"messing about because one was bored.\" Nerp was occasionally substituted for other words, as [appropriate] to the situation and sentence content.",
    "example": "\"I'm [feeling] rather NERPy today.\"\r\n\"[I'm not] doing anything today, man, except [NERPing].\"\r\n\"Do not misuse the NERP!\"",

For night life, you can enjoy a movie at the Carmike theater, complete with sticky floors, urine smell and pestulence. The town mall is complete with shops that are closing down because the residents would rather spend their money on beer and lottery tickets.

    "word": "Bosnia and Herzegovina",
    "definition": "The lands of present day Bosnia and Herzegovina was first inhabited by Illyrian and Celtic tribes until it was conquered by the Romans. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the 4th century, Bosnia was passed on to the [Byzantine Empire]. Between the 6-7th century Slav tribes started settling in what are now Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding lands. The kingdoms of Serbia and Croatia split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century. The Bosnian Kingdom (1353-1463) was ruled mostly by Serbian kings. The Bosnian Kingdom reached its peak under the Serbian king Tvrtko Kotromanic (1338-1391). Between 1463-1483 Bosnia and Herzegovina was completely conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the last Bosnian king was beheaded. During 400 years of Ottoman rule the population of Bosnia kept on changing. War with the Ottomans and the Habsburgs normally caused more migration into Bosnia; the Serbian speaking Bosnian Muslims emerged mainly because allot of people converted to Islam and the large number of settlements of the Jews. By the 19th century the Ottoman Empire became weaker and this sparked Serbian revolts and uprising in 1875; this conflict involved other Balkan states and the [involvement] of European powers, which [eventually] forced the Ottomans to give Bosnia and Herzegovina to be administrated by Austria-Hungary in 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin, and ending four centuries of Ottoman rule. From 1878-1918 Bosnia and Herzegovina was being administrated and then was annexed directly to Austria-Hungary in 1908. Tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary were high over the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina and who would get it. In June 1914 Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb, an event which triggered [the First World War]. After [the First World War] the Austro-Hungarian Empire was defeated and Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. During the [Second World] War the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia in 1941 and Bosnia and Herzegovina were occupied by the Nazi [puppet state] of Croatia. After [World War Two] ended, Bosnia and Herzegovina became one of the six republics of Yugoslavia in 1945, when the country was re-organized as a communist federal state under Josip Broz Tito. By 1990, political, ethnic and religious tensions were high and the country headed towards a collapse. In March 1992 the Bosnian Muslims voted for [independence] even though most Bosnian Serbs boycotted the poll. After the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic announced a separate Bosnian Serb republic the fighting broke out a short while later. The Bosnian Serb forces were assisted by the [Yugoslav] army and the Croatian army did the same for the Bosnian Croats. By 1993 all three forces (Serb, Croats and Muslims) were fighting each other; each side took their own policy of [ethnic cleansing]. The Bosnian War went on from 1992-1995 and costed around one hundred thousand lives. The War was going on through most of 1995 until October when all sides agreed to a truce. All three leaders Milosevic, Izetbegovic and Tudjman signed the Dayton Accords which was an agreement to end the war in former Yugoslavia. The Dayton Accords was the peace plan signed in November 1995 which gave 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Bosnian Serbs.",
    "example": "Bosnia and Herzegovina is located in south-east Europe and it is [the homeland] to the Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Bosnia and Herzegovina borders with Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a very [mountainous] country with lots of rivers and has a small coast on the Adriatic sea (around 20km). Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [population] of 4 million people and it's capital city is Sarajevo.",

Although Sandy Hook is classified as a separate town, it is commonly included in Newtown, seeing as people from both towns attend Newtown Middle School and Newtown High School.\r\n\r\nThe teenagers in Newtown range on and off from the popular cliche cliques. Most of what happens in this town seems like it is some television show due to the amount of people that:\r\n-smoke pot daily to [on the weekends]\r\n-come out as bisexual, gay, lesbian, or not sure\r\n-post or show pictures of nudity\r\n-lie to their parents and/or siblings\r\n-have sex or sexual encounters with a couple to many partners before graduating high school\r\n-take birth control or use condoms\r\n-end up being pregnant\r\n-have an abortion, keep their baby, suffer miscarraige, or give their baby up for adoption\r\n-get an std\r\n-perform self-mutilation (cutting, burning, bruising, etc)\r\n-end up with [mental disorder] (depression, anxiety, etc)\r\n-develop eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, overeating, etc)\r\n-drink many times per week, most of the time just to get drunk\r\n-end up in the hospital (for physical and/or mental reasons)\r\n-become severely injured\r\n-need prescription medication\r\n-cheat on their [significant other]\r\n-cheat on tests, homework, and whatnot\r\n-steal or shoplift\r\n-dye their hair (highlights, combination of colors, brown, blonde, black, red, green, blue, purple, pink, etc)\r\n-end up in therapy or having to go to a special school\r\n-become friends with many people from other towns (brookfield, hartford, shelton, danbury, redding, trumbull, etc)\r\n-spend most to all of their free time on myspace, facebook, and/or aim\r\n-walk throughout the town or hitch rides\r\n-experience their parents divorce, become ill, or pass on\r\n-become suicidal\r\n-skip classes\r\n-run away\r\n-get low self esteem\r\n-get piercings and gages (with or without parental consent; ears, belly button, eyebrows, nose, lip, tongue, facial, etc)\r\n-get tattoos underage\r\n-experiment smoking various things\r\n-experiment with many types of drugs\r\n-sell drugs\r\n-threaten someone (accidently, jokingly, purposely, etc)\r\n-obtain weapon (pocket knife, gun, etc)\r\n-use weapon\r\n-have older-aged people buy them cigarettes\r\n-smoke cigarettes underage and become addicted by or before legal age\r\n-become [attention seeking] and attempt to do something listed above\r\n-have a similar or different problem than what is listed above\r\n-not be one of the people with such common problems like listed above\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem that half to three fourths of a teenager's grade does many of those things, there are some good to well-rounded students that have thought about many of those various issues, known someone or many people with one or more of those various issues, made a decision not to do or be associated with any of those things, and try to do well in school.\r\n\r\nMany [middle schoolers] tend to walk after school to local places like:\r\n-big y (including the parking lot)\r\n-dunkin donuts\r\n-starbucks\r\n-cvs\r\n-andrea's bakery\r\n-dynasty [chinese food]\r\n-library\r\n-the [ice cream shop]\r\n-general store\r\n\r\nMany hang [outs] for a wide range of teenagers include:\r\n-the center (big y and the stores surrounding it)\r\n-friend's houses\r\n-woods and streets\r\n-teen center (inside, outside)\r\n-football games\r\n-edmond town hall (inside, behind, in front)\r\n-cars\r\n-loews/amc theaters\r\n-local stores\r\n-danbury mall\r\n\r\nIt could be that in this town you will:\r\n-meet [the best friends] of your life\r\n-lose [the best friends] of your life\r\n-fall in and/or out of peer pressure\r\n-find someone that you love\r\n-lose someone that you love\r\n-witness some not great moments\r\n-witness some very great moments\r\n-laugh and cry\r\n-learn something (whether it's from school or not)\r\n-find out [what you are] passionate about\r\n-feel let down or like you have messed up\r\n-regain what you have lost\r\n-reach [self-discovery]",

To that end, the term has recieved a connotation that all perons living in southern California are rich, white, asshole, cokeheads.  While this might describe a vast majority of costal community dwellers, it tends to incorporate others who just like the area and say \"fuckoff\" to those rich asshole fuckers.  San Diego, being the farthest south does not have as many of the costal pricks as say, Laguna Beach, or areas of LA that tend to have a lot of coke and rich pricks. ANd just as a reference, [northern california] has the best weed and if you disagree you've never been there. Also Norcal is not any better than Socal it just has fewer people and more trees.

With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.\r\nAlbert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W√ºrttemberg, Germany. He grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that mass-produced electrical equipment. Einstein‚Äôs mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, born two years after him. Einstein attended [elementary school] at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated there and struggled with the institution‚Äôs rigid pedagogical style. He also had what were considered speech challenges.

Upon the child removing all of the pumpkin pulp from both cavities, which was a rather tedious, but, overall, engaging event for the whole onlooking village, they'd yell out the emphatic line in their triumph.\n\n'Thou holes may be foul and rich in ferment, but no evil spirit shall have my newly claimed festive bit of nourishment! Whether sweet or sour, if it takes me more than an hour, no seeds there shall be, as you can now see, two gaping holes abound, we can now share in glee, feast we will on the plunder, evil spirits have met their thunder.'\n\nSo, 'doing the pumpkins' referred to a lovely gathering and seasonal time of fellowship, the first known reference of a DP, a rather ironic deviance from traditional Puritan [values] of chastity, loyalty, and resisting temptations of the flesh, as well as the embracing of food fetishes and butt play.",

(See also: \"United Auto Worker\" and \"Starvation in America\")  Japanese cars are always cheap and junky, although sometimes they are wrapped in expensive plastic or leather, to give the impression of [quality].  \"Giving the impression...\" is what Japanese cars do best (see also: \"Pearl Harbor Sneak Attack\") because they usually do this for 3 or 4 years, and then they disappear, never to be seen or heard from again.  You can usually see the process of Japanese cars returning to the earth beginning on 4-5 year-old examples, usually manifesting as rust holes around the rear wheels.  There is much mythology surrounding \"older\" Japanese cars, but, like the Loch Ness Monster, no one ever actually sees an \"older\" Japanese car.  Compare this to 15-30 year old [American cars], which can be seen on a daily basis.  (As a curiosity, some people have pointed out that [American cars] can not attain 100,000 miles or more.  This is true, all older [American cars] have 5-digit odometers, therefore they can not ever hit 100,000 miles, and so they [automatically] self-destruct at 99,999 miles.)  When General Motors and Ford go out of business, Japanese cars will suddenly triple in price, and the [American government] will contract with Japan for all war vehicles in the future.  Of course, Japan is a peaceful nation (see: \"Bataan Death March\", \"Kamikaze\", \"Comfort Women\", \"Japanese War Crimes\") so with their leadership, there will likely never be another war in the world.",

The end result is one friend breaking the friendship with the other because things got weird or they don't share common feelings of being [more than] just friends. This then leaves the jiltee lonley realizing they wasted their time and should have taken the opportunity to have dated others and missing out on the chance of having probably had a [relationship] and been married even so by that time.",
    "example": "Ken is in a jilted [friendship] with his friend Tara. [Because of this] Natalie will never be able to date her crush Ken as he perceives himself [not to be] a single person cause of Tara.",

The Bible talks about hetero lust more than it talks about homo lust. For instance, say a man sees a woman walking down the street and he goes in his mind \"[Ooh] she's fuckin' sexy I wanna get a [piece of that]\" that is lust. If a man sees another man and thinks the same thing, IT IS STILL LUST. Now if a man falls in love with another man and they both care deeply for each other, the two of them getting physical is okay. It's not ok when there isn't any love involved but just the desire to have sex with another man. Same thing goes for lesbians. So it isn't wrong. Christians need to stop taking the words on the pages of the Bible literally and learn to think!",

    "definition": "Contrary to Popular belief, the word Misgnomer is spelled with a silent g as to refer to a certain set of individuals--those who gnome--that have gone missing. Derived from the modern latin word, gnomus, a gnome is similar to a dwarf, and characteristized by his hesitancy to interact with humans. As a result of their reluctance to associate with humans, the need for persons with a specific set of skills that would allow them to interact with such creatures was required. Thus, the birth of the Gnomer; an individual that has devoted their life to the study and care of gnomes. From breeding to attempting to train these diminutive creatures, Gnomers could engage in variety of specializations for Gnoming. However, as the centuries turned over from the Renaissance Era, the attitude and temperament of gnomes evolved. This evolution led to the need for Gnomers to adapt and Gnoming became more about [controlling] gnomes rather than studying them. As gnomes became more violent, including the famous Gnome Rebellion of 1756, more and more gnomers went missing. These stories include perhaps the most famous Misgnomer, Gregory \"[Little Foot]\" Mactitus, who went missing shortly after the gnome rebellion of 1756 and stories from [Little Foot] being [incorporated] into gnome culture as a diety-like [King] to [Little Foot] being tortured and sacrificed in attempt to turn the Gnome Clan, Dirty Devils, fortunes following their extensive losses during the rebellion.",

The [circumstances] of this [unfortunate] incident are shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, but one of the results of the event was the return to the poet - at his own request - of the poetry volume which had already been presented to Riddell; the second had neither been completed nor sent.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated May 1794, to Riddell's sister in which Burns requests the return of the poetry volume, he refers to its contents as 'a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written ... some of them puerile and silly ...'. This is somewhat insincere and in reality Burns was highly aware of the value of his poems, but it shows his keenness to have returned to him a volume he knew to contain a great compilation of some of his best work.

However, following British colonization of Tasmania in 1803, their habitats were destroyed and many Squilliams were hunted down for their [expensive] furs. The result was brutal fighting between British colonizers and guerilla tribes of Squilliams, armed with whatever they could find. At first, the less-equipped Squilliams struggled with their oppressors, who wielded advanced firearms and horses. However, Squilliams were able to make use of their habitat, which the British colonizers were not familiar with. The British government was no match for these ravenous beasts and were forced to withdraw from the sporadic fighting. Today, Squilliams can once again live free in their homeland and graze on the rich grasses of Tasmania, free from British [oppression].",

The practice of religion is a fundamentally human activity, leading scholars to questions why this should be so. One of the founders of anthropology, Sir Edward B. Tylor argued that religion [originated] in animism, (from anima, ‚Äúspirit‚Äù) from the experiences of ancient peoples in death and dreams. Then, Sir James Frazer collected a massive amount of data from ancient and indigenous cultures and argued that religion [originated] in magic. Later, Sigmund Freud argued from psychoanalysis that God is a projection of a father-figure growing out of the human need to feel secure and the feelings of love-hate-fear we feel. Karl Marx argued it exists as a means of social control and pacification.",

For an unfathamoble and as yet unexplained reason, it was decided the best way to do this would be to masquerade as a [football team].\n\nThis left County with a problem, as fielding a team with 42 legs went against League regulations. Attempts to get around this by removing the rear legs of each sheep proved a rash and unpopular solution, as not only could the sheep not play football, it also made intercourse far more difficult for the good citizens of Derby.\n\nAxed from the group and traumatised by their experiences, yet unwilling to go quietly, the sheep went on to form the Derby County Supporters Club. Their influence can still be seen today in the delusional, stubborn and sexually maladjusted Derby fans.\n\nReplaced with nine [mental institution] outpatients and a cauliflower, County became masters of irony.

While many organizations and individuals are attempting to reinvigorate the community, [the general] populace is still suffering from a \"them vs. us\" mentality of comparison with other cities instead of taking individual [responsibility] for creating and supporting the truly unique aspects Fort Wayne.",

He is also often referred to as 'Richardo Madjokovic', in comparison to the World [Number 1] Novak Djokovic, however this is often viewed as an injustice to his tennis playing abilities. Richard was also raised [in the hood] and regularly slanged dope. He lives the thug life to this day and constantly fucks bitches and makes money. His favourite rap artist of all time is Tupac, who is 99.99% likely to be his father after DNA tests were conducted by [Stephen Hawking] in 2010. According to many close friends and family, Richard has inherited his father's rapping talents and is predicted to unleash his unique skills onto the American hip-hop scene within weeks. There is much speculation that his debut album will be titled 'His eyez on me' as a testimony to his father's life and career. There have been reports that Mad Dog has been dating [Victoria's Secret] models, Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima, at the same time. He is also believed to have fathered [Kanye West] and Kim Kardashian's child, North-West, although he claims he had no say in the naming of the child.",

The students at Boston College are smart, athletic, and attractive. BC often gets a bad rep for preppy, rich, popped collar wearing pricks. While these students exist, they are in the minority and nobody hangs out with them anyways. This reputation likely originates from jealous students at other [universities]. Students at Notre Dame, a very similar university, put too much faith in Notre Dame‚Äôs slightly better rank on most lists of the top academic schools, and now are stuck in the middle of a corn field with [nothing better to do] then hate on BC. Students at Boston University think they have a rivalry with us, but this is impossible because they don‚Äôt have any sports teams. These BU students likely hate on BC and make comparisons to our school because of rampant feelings of [inferiority] circulating throughout their ‚Äúcampus‚Äù. The students at BU pay the same tuition as the students at BC, however this does not make them our equals; the BU students are inferior to BC students in almost every way (namely [intelligence], appearance, athleticism, and [personality]). Students at BC rarely hang out with students at BU and those who do are mainly misguided freshmen who make the mistake of going to a BU frat party (which are all terrible: less booze, more baggage, and a whole lot of ugly chicks), and who will likely never return to BU again. Students at BU are not welcome at BC because they are annoying and obsess over BC, feebly trying to bash BC at every [opportunity]. The BC ‚Äì BU [relationship] is confined to three times a year when we play them in hockey. Usually at some point during BC home hockey games [versus] BU, the BC fans get fed up with the BU fans and start chanting ‚Äúsafety school‚Äù. This is mean but it is also true. The majority of the Massachusetts natives at BC used BU as their safety school. Hopefully, eventually, the BU students will catch on and stop bothering us. Both of these schools hate on BC on a regular basis, however, BC rarely bothers to defend itself. We are more mature than that, and we are too busy partying, and attending sporting events against teams we play on more than a semi-regular basis (like Duke, Virginia, Wake Forest, and [Florida State]).",

The game is set during the aftermath of an [apocalyptic] pandemic outbreak in Pennsylvania. There are four playable characters within the game:\n\nLouis - a junior system's analyst at his company's IT department. PILLS HERE!\n\nBill - a former Green Beret (which explains the hat) and 'Nam vet. The leader of the group and has infinite knowledge of combat.\n\nFrancis - a tattoo covered biker who tends to be the one to save your ass whenever it's on the line for some reason.\n\nZoey - a [college student] and horror film enthusiast. She is the only female of the group which leads to weird moments.\n\nEach campaign, the survivors begin with a M1911 Pistol, which has an unlimited amount of ammo; later on in the campaign, the player can require another pistol, which equals what? Dual pistols beeotch. The pistol is the only weapon you can use when you are [incapacitated]. Yeah, that really helps. Also when starting out, there will be a table with ammo, med kits, pipe bombs, [molotov cocktails] and the choice between a pump-action shotgun or an Uzi. Later on you can get more advanced weapons like an [automatic shotgun], a hunting rifle, and an assault rifle.\n\nThese campaigns have names, No duh. In each campaign, the survivors have to get to a safe house or room, whatever. The goal is to get to an extraction point, where you will receive rescue albeit from an airplane, a boat, a helicopter, etc. Before being rescued, the A.I. Director, who controls when infected attack or not, will send a shitload of infected and special infected to [fuck you up]. This usually is bearable, as long as the team dumbass doesn't wander off.\n\nDeath Toll - a small town and countryside setting, culminating at a dock house.\n\nNo Mercy - an urban setting and [hospital setting], culminating at a hospital skyscraper helipad.\n\nDead Air - an airport setting, culminating at the landing runway of the airport.\n\nBlood Harvest - a farm setting, culminating at a farm house. This is the hardest campaign in the game, hands down.\n\nPeople tend to mistake the enemies for [zombies]. They aren't zombies, they're infected, but hey, whatever floats you're boat.\n\nInfected - a regular \"zombie\" or infected, whatever.\n\nHorde - a huge ass group of infected, which are attracted to loud noises and bright lights. Which means DON'T shoot [the fucking] cars with alarms and DO throw the pipe bomb.\n\nSpecial Infected:\n\nBoomer - special infected who is fat and vomits all over you, which attracts a horde. Whenever you kill him, his fatass explodes, [getting blood] all over you.\n\nSmoker - special infected who can be heard miles away because of his horrendous cough. His tongue is like a thousand feet long and tries to choke yo bitch ass with it. When killing this enemy, he just vanishes into smoke.\n\nHunter - special infected with a liking to blue hoodies. The hunter has a distinct shriek, and can jump high into the air and pounce your ass.\n\nWitch - special infected who is a [crazy ass bitch]. You can tell whenever you are near her, because she is crying. DO NOT be so stupid to believe that she is human. If she is disturbed, she can incapacitate you with one hit. So don't fuck with her, unless you plan on killing her with one shot. What's more fucked up is that in L4D2, she will be able to walk.\n\nTank - special infected who appears to have taken way too much fucking steroids. He's about over 10 feet tall and always seems to be able to pull concrete out of the ground and throw it at you, even though you could be fighting him on grass, but he'll magically be able to pull concrete out of the ground. He can also punch your ass halfway across the map. You can't avoid him, so get an automatic weapon out and unload on his ass.",

Is your knee still bouncing?\n\n*Do you make over $75,000 a year yet still find yourself wearing Vans/New Balance shoes and graphic t-shirts at work and during your free-time?\n\n*Do you shun traditional social gatherings that require that you interact with non-intellectual scum (read: non-academics that have 9-5's and/or lowly humanity degrees) and that requires that you shave/brush your teeth/switch out one Stanford sweatshirt for another?\n\n*Do you have multiple food/pet/medication allergies that require you to keep an EpiPen in the glovebox of your leased Accord?",

[Unfortunately], this is a [chronic condition] that often goes untreated in most; often thriving in hi-tech companies and Toast Master gatherings.\n\nExample:\r\nNon-SVS friend: This party is SO awkward! Everyone is totally wasted...but they're all talking about stem cell imaging or their boring day-trips to Napa. I haven't looked anyone in the eye for like, two hours!\n\nMore experienced non-SVS friend: Sigh. I know. Everyone here has Silicon Valley syndrome like WHOA.",
