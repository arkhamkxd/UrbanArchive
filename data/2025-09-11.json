Usually it isn't found in really thin women (usually you just see their actual spine) nor heavyset women (whose backs are usually just doughey and flat). Most men, consciously or not, find this part of the body sexy.\r\n\r\nThe reason this area is called a Cum Trough is because when engaging in [doggy style] sex or a facsimile thereof, the man may be so inclined to pull out of the woman and [ejaculate] on her mid back. Rather than just leaking every which way, the Cum Trough acts as a trench or trough of sorts and causes all the semen to stay in a neat straight line on the woman's back, presumably until she stands up/rolls to either side.",

    "word": "scouser",
    "definition": "Scousers are an [interesting] result of the [industrial revolution] and Liverpool is a true immigrant city equalled only with London, New York and Buenos Aires. Most Scousers are of Irish and Welsh descent though the city has long standing Chinese, West African and Scandinavian communities with the term 'Scouser' coming from the dish 'Lobscouse' which is a bastardization of the Norwegian word 'labskaus' which is a Norwegian lamb/mutton stew.\r\n\r\nI have read a lot of the enteries on here and knowing the city and a lot of the people I feel I can make a decent unbiased job of writing a fair review about Liverpool.\r\n\r\nScousers are famous for the [sense of humour], though they can laugh at others and do so regulary, they cannot laugh at themselves, any joke about Liverpool is taken as a great insult, Scousers tend to have a [victimized]/martyrdom complex but despite this they are capable of great acts of charity and benevolence. Scousers more often than not employ a disarming but [superficial] friendliness to strangers - it is only when you get to know a Scouser that they start to grate.\r\n\r\nScousers have a 'big man' complex, most Scousers are not physically big nor physically hard though they are able to intimdate people through shouting at them with a guttural accent that has changed a lot in the past 30 years so they can sound more tough. Scousers can be violent and aggresive but the vast majority cannot fight to save their life - another paradox of [this is that] Liverpool is a famous amateur boxing city and has produced many fighters in the lighter weight divsions though never a really good big man and they never will due to the typical Scousers puny physique.\r\n\r\nThe 'Big Man' complex is more apparent in the workplace, Scousers as a rule loath to work but when forced to put in a days graft, Scousers all want to be the boss - 99.9% of them aren't capable of bossing a lemming over the cliff but their attitude to earning a honest living means they aren't receptive to working 8 hours a day under the orders of someone else - strikes and [industrial action] is still common in Liverpool even in these fraught times - Scousers therefore like to go into small business such as [window cleaning] and market stall trading and the shadier ones go into petty crime such as burgulary, drug dealing etc.\r\n\r\nLiverpool is a great city in many ways that has inspired great artists,\r\nwriters, poets and musicians and is [one of the most] aestheically beautiful architectural cities in the world - however Scousers have a [love hate relationship] with Manchester - a horrid shit tip 30 miles away - It is lost on the majority of Scousers that the Mancunian is the most closest thing to a Scouser you can get in look, attitude and lifestyle. Scousers are nothing like Geordies or Glaswegians like they purport to be, but the Scouser and the Mancunian is an near identical animal.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you will never ever hear a Scouser saying is 'Oh! I never/didn't know that?' Scousers know [everything] about anything. A Scouser will never admit to not knowing about any subject on planet earth and is quite capable of telling a [brain surgeon] how to do thier job despite the fact the Scouser in question might be a milkman or a doley or something equally as tragic.\r\n\r\nScousers have a highly developed and protective sense of self, they are proud to be born in the city and any 'Texan' 'Plazzy' or 'Wool' who claims to be [one of them] is going to get the heave ho before long, they are not tolerant of non Scousers claiming to be Scousers. \r\n\r\nEven the good people of Birkenhead, Kirkby, Huyton and Skem are seen as 'plazzies' even though the rest of the planet see them as Scousers. It is a complex state of affairs. (If you are from Skem that is!)\r\n\r\nThe true Scouse accent is Celtic in origin, it is a mixture of Welsh, Irish and Lancastrian dialects, the lilting sounds of John Lennon have now been replaced by the rasping, guttural sound\r\nof the Scouser of today - apparentley \r\nTVs Eastenders is the biggest influence in the change of the accent over the past 30 years!\r\n\r\nLiverpool has a higher ratio of beautiful women than in other parts of the UK down to the high racial mixing \r\nof the populace - its is not uncommon for your bog standard Scouser to have a \r\nSomalian/Paraguayan/Egypt ian/Burmese etc grandparent or great grandparent which leads to attractive women - though their attractivness is negated by their big mouths and bad attitudes - mind you\r\nthey have been dealing with their male [counterparts] since birth so I can [understand] it but I wouldn't want any part of it!\r\n\r\nI could do a piece about the football but a) It has been covered ad nauseum and b) I would have to mention Heysel and the pre 1989 'Munich 58' song.",

It [eventually] caught on throughout the midwest and it's [definition] has been altered in many blasphemous ways. The original definition of \"Nerp\" was an acronym which meant \"Never Eat Rice Pudding.\" It meant that there was \"NERP on top of a chicken, or chicken on top of NERP.\" Nerp was therefore occasionally an unknown substance which could be alternately underneath or on top of a (live) chicken. There were variations among the original users, such as \"NERPing\" which roughly meant \"messing about because one was bored.\" Nerp was occasionally substituted for other words, as [appropriate] to the situation and sentence content.",
    "example": "\"I'm [feeling] rather NERPy today.\"\r\n\"[I'm not] doing anything today, man, except [NERPing].\"\r\n\"Do not misuse the NERP!\"",
