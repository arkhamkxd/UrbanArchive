It came from the Old French word gai, and arrived in English during the 12th century.\n\nIV. These days 'gay' is, wrongly, used to refer to something (namely an [inanimate object], for example a bag) that is unfavourable. Synonyms of this sort include 'sad' and 'lame'. They are all wrong, because an inanimatr object, such as a bag, presumably do not have feelings (sorry, bags, if you do) and therefore they cannot be sad, and this is a ridiculously derived insult. Bags do not have legs either, and thus they cannot be lame. But the supposed 'insult' of 'gay' annoys me most. Firstly because an [inanimate object], such as a bag, cannot really be attracted to other things of the same sex. According to humans, as we made them, they do not have genders of their own.\n\nOffensive, rude, and not-to-be-used 'synonyms' include faggot, fag and [queer], the latter not being as bad and commonly used by gays themselves - but there are many more worse ones. For lesbians there is dyke, lez and lezzer, but there are probably far worse for these too.\n\nA woman or girl who has many gay male friends is sometimes known as a fag hag.\n\nGay is not an insult.\n\nI love gay people.",
    "example": "I. Two gay men live happily up the road. :)\n\nII. The gays said they were going clubbing.\n\nIII. We'll have a gay old time.\r\nHe felt light and gay, and began to dance for joy.\n\nIV. Omg dat's like so gay innit. Faggooot. :(\n\n--\n\n\"Gay is not an insult.\"\n\n\"I love gay people.\"\n\n--\n\nCain - \"[I just had sex] with Marcus.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Good grief, Cain, that makes you gay!\"\n\nCain - \"Hell it does, lad.\"\n\nAlaric - \"Well [I like you] no less. In fact I like you more.\"\n\n[This is good].",

The myth of the giant burnso was originated from early 1400's, where a seafarer traveling to seek land first came across the giant burnso. After the capsized vessel was found floating on shore, the sea man was found in the boat truly scared to death, his eyes wide open, only no words were ever to be spoken from him again. On a note they found the words \"it was the giant burnso\". After days passed he finally spoke of his tragic meeting with this creature, his voice shaky he described that once he looked into the cold eyes of the burnso, he went numb. He heard a horrific screeching come from the beast, all he could make out from the screams was the words \"burnso, giant burnso\". Finally the creature picked up the man, and the way he described it was he felt like the creature was actually sucking the life from his mouth. His body than went limp, and the creature disappeared. Other stories have been similar to that of the sea mans tragic meeting, only the others all describe the colors of the burnso as [everything but] pink, some say a [yellow tail], with a gian [brown beard], while others only say they saw green.

    "definition": "Tinychan is a [bulletin board] system (BBS) which is operated by a system operator (SysOp) known as Jan.\n\n[The community] is semi-anonymous - that is, you can choose to remain under the anonymous default, or you can give yourself a name using a tripcode which makes it easier for other users to identify you.\n\nUnlike similar BBS forums, such as AnonTalk, Tinychan permits discussion which is not 100% relevant to the topic in which it is posted. While this may seem disorganized, it is a much more [efficient] way of running a board than enforcing stringent rules, which can be seen on Tinychan's archenemy, AnonTalk's board.\n\nTinychan has a number of helpful mods who are all very welcoming and enjoy a hearty chuckle (especially if it's at the expense of Kimmo Alm, the SysOp of Anontalk).",
    "example": "Jamie: Man, I am so sick of that pedophile-ridden board, AnonTalk. I wish I could find another anonymous board which doesn't have those nasty [pedophiles] or those fucked up rules.\r\nNatasha: Have you tried Tinychan? It's [practically] identical, but over nine thousand times better.\r\nJamie: Thanks. I'll have to [check it out].",
