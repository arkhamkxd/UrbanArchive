They are incredibly hard to kill, as they live forever, and are witty and cunning little creatures. Many die due to their own stupidity, because all Farfuls are stupid to some degree. One characteristic that they all share is their craftiness and sassiness. They are not good at planning ahead, and are not aware of what is going on around them. That being said, they are good at strategy and [entertainment].\n\nThere are many species of Farfuls. The three main groups are Farfuls, Shiblies, and Crawlies. To give a Farful a name you simply put his profession in front of the word \"Farfuls\". For example, Carpenter Farfuls, Chef Farfuls, Stripper Farfuls, Drag Queen Farfuls, or Realtor Farfuls. There are also, of course, just plain old family farfuls.",
    "example": "For example, one Farful I know has a bipolar characteristic, and is very funny. He acts [like a little] like a [small child], and thinks his way is the best way to do something. He loves sparkles and the colour pink. He sleeps in a homemade bed made out of a washcloth and a tiny hand sewn pillow. He is not able to [go to the bathroom] alone, and you always have to keep an eye on him.",

Strange enough, but then there were the side effects, such as nausea, vertigo, and even night terrors. Stranger still, men in black, supposedly government agents, often visited the machines, giving rise to rumors of a [government mind control] program. A month later after the machine was first spotted, it vanished, along with any evidence of its existence. The only consistency in the story is the name, Polybius.\n\nWild story, but it actually has some basis in fact. Around the same time and place the myth was set, incidents of teens [blacking out] or experiencing similar side effects to the described symptoms after marathons of games such as Asteroids or Tempest, began to crop up. Also, back during that time, Arcades were often the haunts of drug dealers and other participants in illicit activities, resulting in common sightings of Narcotics officers during hours of operation. Finally, the name springs from one of the codenames of Tempest while it was in its beta stages, Polybius.",

    "word": "gaying up",
    "definition": "1. \"Gaying up\" is one of those phrases that works on the various pejorative meanings of gay, in this instance to mean screwed up or not functioning correctly to some degree. This works forwards from the traditional belief that there is something inherently messed up about [homosexuality] and extends [the definition] of 'gay' accordingly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to gay something up is to ruin or corrupt it, especially through socially unpleasant or malicious behaviour, and for something to become 'gayed up' is for it to work to a less than satisfactory level, especially due to faulty wiring or some other internal defect.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is little homophobic intent in the use of these words.\r\n\r\n2. \"Gaying up\" can also be used as one of those phrases that works on the stereotypical aspects of gayness. If a club, or room, or 30-minute television show, is 'gayed up', it will undoubtedly have one of the following: flashing lights, colourful streamers, loud, bassy trance music, a disco ball, leather, bondage accessories, pastel colours, Liza Minelli, some camp bastard, mincing, open Hawaian shirts, YMCA by [The Village People] and various other things that a more politically-correct society might associate with [homosexuality] and sexual liberation in its friendlier stereotyping, and the kind of things [homosexuals] should probably try to distance themselves from.\r\n\r\nSimilar in definition to sexed up, in that it's made spicier, but gayed up is less likely to refer to lying in political documents to cajole a country to war. A 'gayed up' dossier would probably contain copious 'oohs' and 'doesn't that sound lovely?'",
    "example": "1. \"[Fucking Hell], why did you invite Ronan Keating to my party? He's sitting around singing stupid acoustic songs, drinking Strongbow straight from the bottle, and insisting we all watch Narnia. He's totally gayed the [whole thing] up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry I got cut off, your majesty, but my mobile 'phone is gaying up.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Join us for a gayed-up version of [David Letterman], tonight, where Letterman will wear shorts and the short guy with the band will be kitted out in a gimp costume. And it'll be very colourful too, and we'll probably change the theme-tune to something slightly demeaning towards gays.\"",

The members of the pack will not openly flirt with or even talk to the catcher if others are around because of fear that they might be publicly rejected.\n\nThere is little that a non-professional can do to help these individuals as they are very set in their ways. It is commonly said that after a [year] or two, the [average Dog] Catcher is so set in his ways that he will continue to chase after and catch 'dogs' for the rest of his miserable life.",

Going to\n\nwork, guessing about 30 miles from the store in the opposite direction of your house, it takes him, with the given 0.05 mph, about 600 hours or 0.07 years, to get to his work.\n\nThat is if, and only if, a cop does not pull over your father for the 200th time for diving immensely slow. It would be a usual sentence of fewer than 30 days. However, your father has been there a lot and the judge has had enough of your father being a [public nuisance]. This makes the judge sentence your father to jail time for 50 years. Worst-case scenario, your father is sentenced to a lifetime jail residence so make that infinite years.\n\nHowever, let's not think that way. He gets to work and has to work for the listed 950, 000 days (roughly 2666.67 years). Getting back to the store will take another 0.07 years, buying the milk will take about 50 more years with the state your father's mind is in. Finally, it will take another 697.01 years to get home.\n\nTotaled up, this is an [approximate] 4160.83 years for your father to come back home with the milk. [Unfortunately], the milk is spoiled by the time he gets home, unless it's the special \"Never Go Bad Milk\" brand, which is [probably not] the case since your father probably read the label wrong and got the \"Goes Bad in 3 Seconds Milk\" brand instead. Thus repeating the never-ending cycle.",
