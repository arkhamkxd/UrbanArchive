That being said, they are good at strategy and [entertainment].\n\nThere are many species of Farfuls. The three main groups are Farfuls, Shiblies, and Crawlies. To give a Farful a name you simply put his profession in front of the word \"Farfuls\". For example, Carpenter Farfuls, Chef Farfuls, Stripper Farfuls, Drag Queen Farfuls, or Realtor Farfuls. There are also, of course, just plain old family farfuls.",
    "example": "For example, one Farful I know has a bipolar characteristic, and is very funny. He acts [like a little] like a [small child], and thinks his way is the best way to do something. He loves sparkles and the colour pink. He sleeps in a homemade bed made out of a washcloth and a tiny hand sewn pillow. He is not able to [go to the bathroom] alone, and you always have to keep an eye on him.",

Strange enough, but then there were the side effects, such as nausea, vertigo, and even night terrors. Stranger still, men in black, supposedly government agents, often visited the machines, giving rise to rumors of a [government mind control] program. A month later after the machine was first spotted, it vanished, along with any evidence of its existence. The only consistency in the story is the name, Polybius.\n\nWild story, but it actually has some basis in fact. Around the same time and place the myth was set, incidents of teens [blacking out] or experiencing similar side effects to the described symptoms after marathons of games such as Asteroids or Tempest, began to crop up. Also, back during that time, Arcades were often the haunts of drug dealers and other participants in illicit activities, resulting in common sightings of Narcotics officers during hours of operation. Finally, the name springs from one of the codenames of Tempest while it was in its beta stages, Polybius.",

    "word": "gaying up",
    "definition": "1. \"Gaying up\" is one of those phrases that works on the various pejorative meanings of gay, in this instance to mean screwed up or not functioning correctly to some degree. This works forwards from the traditional belief that there is something inherently messed up about [homosexuality] and extends [the definition] of 'gay' accordingly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to gay something up is to ruin or corrupt it, especially through socially unpleasant or malicious behaviour, and for something to become 'gayed up' is for it to work to a less than satisfactory level, especially due to faulty wiring or some other internal defect.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is little homophobic intent in the use of these words.\r\n\r\n2. \"Gaying up\" can also be used as one of those phrases that works on the stereotypical aspects of gayness. If a club, or room, or 30-minute television show, is 'gayed up', it will undoubtedly have one of the following: flashing lights, colourful streamers, loud, bassy trance music, a disco ball, leather, bondage accessories, pastel colours, Liza Minelli, some camp bastard, mincing, open Hawaian shirts, YMCA by [The Village People] and various other things that a more politically-correct society might associate with [homosexuality] and sexual liberation in its friendlier stereotyping, and the kind of things [homosexuals] should probably try to distance themselves from.\r\n\r\nSimilar in definition to sexed up, in that it's made spicier, but gayed up is less likely to refer to lying in political documents to cajole a country to war. A 'gayed up' dossier would probably contain copious 'oohs' and 'doesn't that sound lovely?'",
    "example": "1. \"[Fucking Hell], why did you invite Ronan Keating to my party? He's sitting around singing stupid acoustic songs, drinking Strongbow straight from the bottle, and insisting we all watch Narnia. He's totally gayed the [whole thing] up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry I got cut off, your majesty, but my mobile 'phone is gaying up.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Join us for a gayed-up version of [David Letterman], tonight, where Letterman will wear shorts and the short guy with the band will be kitted out in a gimp costume. And it'll be very colourful too, and we'll probably change the theme-tune to something slightly demeaning towards gays.\"",

The members of the pack will not openly flirt with or even talk to the catcher if others are around because of fear that they might be publicly rejected.\n\nThere is little that a non-professional can do to help these individuals as they are very set in their ways. It is commonly said that after a [year] or two, the [average Dog] Catcher is so set in his ways that he will continue to chase after and catch 'dogs' for the rest of his miserable life.",

Going to\n\nwork, guessing about 30 miles from the store in the opposite direction of your house, it takes him, with the given 0.05 mph, about 600 hours or 0.07 years, to get to his work.\n\nThat is if, and only if, a cop does not pull over your father for the 200th time for diving immensely slow. It would be a usual sentence of fewer than 30 days. However, your father has been there a lot and the judge has had enough of your father being a [public nuisance]. This makes the judge sentence your father to jail time for 50 years. Worst-case scenario, your father is sentenced to a lifetime jail residence so make that infinite years.\n\nHowever, let's not think that way. He gets to work and has to work for the listed 950, 000 days (roughly 2666.67 years). Getting back to the store will take another 0.07 years, buying the milk will take about 50 more years with the state your father's mind is in. Finally, it will take another 697.01 years to get home.\n\nTotaled up, this is an [approximate] 4160.83 years for your father to come back home with the milk. [Unfortunately], the milk is spoiled by the time he gets home, unless it's the special \"Never Go Bad Milk\" brand, which is [probably not] the case since your father probably read the label wrong and got the \"Goes Bad in 3 Seconds Milk\" brand instead. Thus repeating the never-ending cycle.",

    "definition": "1) When you go into a pub or a bar (in the UK mostly) and you are either underage or merely old enough to drink and you are with your parents or another clearly grown adult and they order you a beer or a cider and the bartender notices that even though they might be ordering it, you are drinking it and on the basis of them knowing that your going to drink it they ask you for ID.\n\n2) When a group of youths the same age walk into a pub or bar and when one person orders who drink the bartender asks the whole group for ID. Basically if each and every one of the group doesn't have ID then none of them will get served.\n\nBoth of these scenarios are typical of [Wetherspoons] as they are well known for being extremely strict when it comes to asking for ID and they do not [appreciate] one bit any scummy underagers on their premises getting boozed up under any [circumstances].",
    "example": "*Father and son walk into bar*\r\nFather: Hello, could I have two pints of Stella please.\r\nBartender: Is one of those for that lad sat [on the table] [over there]?\r\nFather: Well yes.\r\nBartender: Could I check that lads ID please?\r\n*Son overhears and walks over*\r\nSon: Well The [Wetherspoons] Effect has most certainly kicked in hasn't it!",

Ghetto chicks have a very limited [vocabulary], and attempt to [make up for it], by forming new words, such as \"[constipulated]\", or simply cursing [persistently], or using other types of vulgarities, and making noises, such as \"hmmg!\", or smacking their lips, and making other angry noises,grunts, and faces.  \r\n\r\n Many ghetto chicks drive a raggedy car, and play vulgar rap music very loudly, with the [windows rolled down], even on Sunday afternoons.  They also often have lots of kids, by lots of different men, one or more of which is serving time.  Usually a ghetto chick will also be on food stamps or welfare, and/or section eight, even when she has a man secretly living with her. Ghetto chicks also think it looks classy to get super long acrylic nails, with jewels and designs on them, sometimes even wearing their toenails the same way.  They often have their feet decorated, but forget to scrub off the dead, dry skin, thus making their feet look crusty. \r\n\r\nMost ghetto girls are very jealous and dramatic, and will fight at any time, for any small reason. Ghetto chicks HATE well-spoken, [intelligent], attractive, well-mannered women, and will often call them names, such as stuck-up bitches, snob, white girl, or Barbie. Ghetto chicks feel very threatened by classy, intelligent women.  Ghetto chicks are often aggressive, have no manners, and no home training.  They will often steal, and commit violent acts as well.  You should not threaten, or offend, or even look a ghetto chick directly in the eyes, unless you know you can defend yourself in a fight, possibly even involving a weapon. Ghetto chicks should be avoided at all times, if at all possible.

She has an impeccable sense of humor that can fit into any and every situation, whether it's an icebreaker at a funeral, one that will crack up elders, or an insanely explicit (usually sexual) comment, which could only be mentioned whilst among friends.\n\nShe can be devious and a bit leery, although, she hides her true intentions behind a mask of innocence.\n\nShe is usually extremely sexual, even though she might not expose that side of her to the outside world. She is the sexual godess all men (and some women) fantasise about, with an appetite and taste for sex that appeals to roughly everyone. She is both Madonna and the Whore, which some lucky gals and fellas will come to notice. However, she tends to [use] sex as a way to pay/repay a purchase or favor, although that seldom happens.\n\nShe most defiantly has a sugar daddy (matter of fact, she probably has a number of [sugar daddies]), but rarely dares to commit in such things as [relationships].\n\nIn conclusion, the most beautiful, perfect and exciting sin you'll ever come across in your life, a solid ten on any scale.",

    "definition": "'Blackbird' box poses serious theft threat   3/1/2004 \r\nTORONTO - A new, card-free, theft-enabling satellite set top box which allows users free access to all Dish Network and Bell ExpressVu programming has hit [the black market] within the past 10 weeks or so - and this one is apparently unaffected by satellite company [electronic] counter measures (ECMs).\r\nThe box, available for sale on ebay and underground web retailers, is called Blackbird. The sites are billing the box as a legal, free-to-air receiver that just happens to allow access to all Dish Network programming. And, since ExpressVu's technology is identical, the box lets users steal from [the Canadian] DTH company as well.\r\nBlackbird has caused such a scare [in the States] that when speaking to delegates at a Cablelabs conference last week, Comcast president Brian Roberts mentioned the box by name and urged Dish Network to take immediate, drastic action, according to those in attendance.\r\nThe box comes with no conditional access card and, say those who have seen it, can not be disabled by satellite company ECMs. It does not work with DirecTV or Star Choice.\r\n\"No more JTAGs, AVRs, Atmegas, ROM X Cards, ISO Programmers, and TSOP locks,\" says one web site, telling thieves they no longer have to worry about buying hacked cards, readers, loaders or anything else.\r\nThe Blackbird comes with a four-way connector, meaning that up to four dishes could be tied into the box. With seven Dish Network and ExpressVu satellites to choose from, depending on which of the birds the dishes are pointed at, such a thief could get in the [neighborhood] of 1,200 channels on one television through this box.\r\n\"You can connect up to 4 different LNBs to a 4-way switch (included) and one output to the receiver. Blackbird will [understand] each [individual] LNB signal, and download all the channels for that satellite. For instance, if one LNB were pointing as Dish Network, you would set up LNB 1 to download all 300 DishNet stations (PPV, sports, [everything]). This would populate channels 1-300 on the system,\" says one web site.\r\n\"If LNB 2 were pointing at another satellite company, you would then be able to set up LNB 2 to download channels 301-600. This can continue for up to 4 different satellite signals. Potentially, with enough dishes, you could flip from channels 1-1200, without missing any stations!! Although you cannot get DirecTV, you can use your existing DirecTV dish on your house, and the LNB, as long as you properly re-point the dish to another satellite, such as Dish Network.\"\r\nThe site, of course, also claims that all of this is, ahem, [perfectly legal].\r\nIt's selling in the US$370 range.\r\nBell ExpressVu president Tim McGee told www.cablecastermagazine.com on Friday that his company became aware of Blackbird in December and is [working on] how it can combat it.\r\nHe downplayed its potential effect on the company. \"It's just another pirated device that can be used to steal,\" he said. \"We're well ahead of the curve in terms of our knowledge of it. It's a niche product\"\r\nMcGee didn't say for sure whether or not the company's ECMs work to disable the box but several technical contacts in the cable industry with knowledge of Blackbird or who have seen it work, say current ECMs, which target hacked plastic cards inside set top receivers do not affect Blackbird.\r\n\"The best way at this point to fight it is to choke off any avenue of [distribution] and sale of this,\" added McGee. \"That's the main thrust at this stage.\"\r\n\"It's not affected by ECMs,\" confirmed one cable executive who has seen the Blackbird work.\r\nIndustry Canada and Telesat recently conducted a test of the box in Ottawa and found that it appears pretty bullet-proof and is a serious threat to satellite signal security. Blackbird is a name which is beginning to reverberate throughout the TV [distribution] industry which is understandably spooked by the product.\r\nIt is another reason behind the redoubling of efforts to get Bill C-2 passed, which will dramatically toughen measures against satellite signal thieves.\r\nCable sources told www.cablecastermagazine.com that the box, when coming over the border, may operate as a free-to-air receiver, making it a \"legal\" at most points in the [distribution] chain. It is obviously altered once in the country, making it able to receive all digital ExpressVu and EchoStar signals.\r\nThose sources also say the technology [originated] in Israel - which right now is a hotbed of emerging encryption [technologies]. ExpressVu says the hardware appears to be made in Taiwan.",

The FARC emerged after a massive military offensive against peasant groups seeking land reform in the 1950s.  They saw armed struggle as the only way to change things since the \"[democratic]\" channels proved [unsuccessful].  During the 1980s, a brief democratic opening in the country's political institutions prompted many FARC members to put down their weapons and [participate] in the political process through the creation of [political parties] and a renewed union movement.  However, the murder of many of these activists strengthened the conviction of the remaining FARC members that democracy in Colombia is a sham.  As a result, today's FARC is more brutal than ever; it has [practically] forgotten the reason it took to armed struggle in the first place.  It has little support and its only source of revenue is through kidnappings.\r\n\r\nContrary to the previous entry, the FARC are not involved in the drug trade -- or at least it is very, very minimal.  The right-wing paramilitaries, congealed in the AUC, are actually the ones whose links with drug trafficking run deep.  The AUC initially began as scattered armed groups funded by large landholders opposing land reform (which the FARC advocated).  During the 1970s, and especially the 1980s, the influence of Colombia's drug cartels was extended to the country's civil war.  They began arming and funding the paramilitaries, whose [operations] were conducted out of the coca-growing regions.  Needless to say, the druglords opposed land reform as much as the landlords, as that would mean eradication of their income base.",
